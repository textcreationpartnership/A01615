            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST FAMOVS YONG GENTLEMEN, AS WELL FOR RELIGION, MODESTIE, AND OTHER VERTVES, AS AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for kinred, <hi>Francis Hastings,</hi> and <hi>Edward Bacon,</hi> moſt heartie ſalutations.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter <hi>Solon</hi> (right Worſhipfull yong men) had ſeene <hi>Thespis</hi> his firſt edition and action of a Tragoedie, and meeting vvith him before the playe, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, If he vvere not aſhamed to publiſh ſuch feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fables under ſo noble, yet a counterfeit perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: <hi>Theſpis</hi> anſwered, That it vvas no diſgrace upon a ſtage (merrily and in ſport) to ſay and do any thing. Then <hi>Solon</hi> (ſtriking hard upon the earth vvith his ſtaffe) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thus: Yea but ſhortly, vve that now like and embrace this play, ſhall finde it practiſed in our contracts and common affaires. This man of deepe underſtanding, ſaw that publicke diſcipline and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of manners affected and attempted once in ſport and ieaſt, vvould ſoone quaile: &amp; corruption, at the beginning paſsing in play, vvould fall and end in earneſt. Therefore <hi>Tacitus</hi> vvorthily dooth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the manners of the Germanes of his time, amongſt vvhom, vices were not laughed at. For laughters begun of ſome publick ſhame and diſhoneſtie, wil aſſuredly procure him ſome miſerable calamitie. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of France is unto all ages and nations a vvofull view, yet a profitable inſtruction at this day. For vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cleare light of the Goſpell began firſt to ſpring and appeare, Sathan (to occupie and buſie mens minds vvith toyiſh playes and trifles, that they might give no attendance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to true vviſedome) deviſed this policie, to raiſe up jeaſters and fooles in Courts, vvhich creeping in, by quipping and prettie conceits, firſt in vvords, and after by bookes, uttering their pleaſant ieaſts in the Courts and banquets of kings and princes, laboured to root up all the true principles of Religion and Policie. And ſome there vvere vvhom the reſemblance of nature, or vanitie of wit had ſo deceived, that they
<pb facs="tcp:21818:3"/>
derided the everlaſting veritie of the true God, as if it were but a fable. <hi>Rabelayſus</hi> amongſt the French, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> amongſt the Germanes, were the ſtanderd bearers of that traine<hi>:</hi> which with their skoffing taunts, inveighed not only againſt the Goſpell, but all good arts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Thoſe mockers did not as yet openly undermine the ground work of humane ſocietie, but only they derided it: But ſuch Cyclopian laughters, in the end prooved to be onely ſignes and tokens of future evils. For by little and little, that which was taken in the beginning for ieſtes, turned to earneſt, &amp; words into deedes. In the necke of theſe came new Poets, very eloquent for their owne profit, which incenſed unto luſt &amp; lightneſſe, ſuch mindes as were alreadie inclined to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, by quickening their appetites with the delectable ſauſe of unchaſt hearing; and pricking them forward with the ſharp ſpurres of pleaſure. Who could then bridle vices and iniquities, vvhich are fed with much wealth, and no leſſe libertie? ſeeing them not onely in play, mirth, and laughter entertained; but alſo earneſtly accepted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as being very excellent. Yet ſome troad the ſteps of honeſty, which now lay a dying, and practiſed the ould manners and faſhions, which were almoſt forgotten. For although the ſecret faults of the Court were evill ſpoken of, yet ſhame ſtoode in open view; hainous &amp; infamous crimes kept ſecret corners; princes were of ſome credit and faith; lawes were in reaſonable good uſe; magiſtrates had their due au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and reverence; all things onely for oſtentation and outward ſhew, but none would then have feared an utter deſtruction: For than Sathan being a diſguiſed perſon amongſt the French, in the likeneſſe of a merry ieaſter, acted a Comaedie, but ſhortly enſued a wofull Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedie. When our countrie mens minds were ſick, and corrupted with theſe peſtilent diſeaſes, and that diſcipline vvaxed ſtale; then came forth the books of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> a moſt pernitious vvriter, vvhich began not in ſecret and ſtealing manner (as did thoſe former vices) but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen meanes, and as it vvere a continuall aſſault, utterly deſtroyed, not this or that vertue, but even all vertues at once: Inſomuch as it tooke Faith from the princes; authoritie and maieſtie, from lavves; libertie from the people; and peace and concord from all perſons, vvhich are the onely remedies for preſent malladies. For vvhat ſhall I ſpeake of Religion, vvhereof the Machiavellians had none, as already plainelie appeareth; yet they greatly laboured alſo, to deprive us of the ſame. And although they have vvrongfully banniſhed us our native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, yet fight vvee ſtill for the Churches defence. Moreover Sathan
<pb facs="tcp:21818:3"/>
uſeth ſtrangers of France, as his fitteſt inſtruments, to infect us ſtil with this deadly poyſon ſent out of Italie, vvho have ſo highly promoted their Machivellian bookes, that he is of no reputation in the Court of France, vvhich hath not <hi>Machiavels</hi> vvritings at the fingers ends, and that both in the Italian and French tongues, &amp; can apply his precepts to all purpoſes, as the Oracles of <hi>Apollo.</hi> Truly it is a wonderfull thing to conſider how faſt that evill weede hath growne within theſe fewe yeares, ſeeing there is almoſt none that ſtriveth to excell in vertue or knowledge: as though the onely way to obteine honour and riches were by this deceivers direction. But now to turne mine eyes from beholding ſo many miſeries of poore afflicted France, as often as I ſee or remember our neighbour countries (which thing I doe daily) ſo often doe I bevvaile our miſeries: Yet am I right ioyfull for your felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; chiefely becauſe God of his great bounty, hath given you a moſt renowned Queene, as well in deede, as title, even in the middeſt of ſo many troubles: For ſhe comming to the crowne, even when England was toſſed with tempeſtuous ſtormes, ſo diſperſed thoſe cloudes, with the brightneſſe of her counſell and countenance, that no civile diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor externall invaſion, hath diſturbed your peace &amp; tranquilitie, theſe many yeeres, eſpecially ſo many vvarres ſounding on every ſide: For ſhee by maintaining vvholeſome unitie amongſt all degrees, hath hitherto preſerved the State of her realme, not onely ſafe but floriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not by Machiavelian artes, as Guile, Perfidie, and other Villanies practiſing: but by true vertues, as Clemencie, Iuſtice, Faith. Therfore goeth ſhe her progreſſe throgh her realme of England, entertained in all places with happy applauſe, reioyſing, &amp; proſperitie of all her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, ſhe being a princeſſe, of both Nobles and commons, by dew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert moſt entirely beloved: Whereas vve againſt our vvils, behold our countrie ſvvimming in blood, and diſfigured by ſubverſion, vvhich is a ioyfull obiect to the eyes of ſtrangers, yea and thoſe labour moſt to vvork her deſtruction, vvho ſhould bee moſt carefull to reſcue &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver poore France, out of her long calamities: but the Lord vvill at length behould our miſeries. But O hovv happy are yee, both becauſe you have ſo gratious a Queene, &amp; alſo for that the infectious Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velian doctrine, hath not breathed nor penetrated the intrails of moſt happy England. But that it might not ſo doe, I have done my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to provide an Antidote and preſent remedie, to expell the force of ſo deadly poyſon, if at any time it chance to infect you. For vvhen I thought it meete and right (eſpecially in ſuch a confuſed diſorder of
<pb facs="tcp:21818:4"/>
matters and times) to impart as vvell to our Frenchmen, as to other nations theſe diſcourſes, firſt vvritten by a man of moſt ſingular lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vviſedome, I vvillingly undertooke this labour, vvhich I have performed to the uttermoſt of my povver, and novv I vvholy refer my ſelfe and my travaile, to ſerve for the benefit of publicke utilitie: Yet I properly dedicated and inſcribed it in your names; both becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I never ſavv England, yet it might ſerve as a pledge, to teſtifie my thankfull minde tovvards your countrymen, vvhoſe ſingular cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie &amp; kindneſſe ſhevved to my bretheren, vvhen they vvere baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, hath generally bound mee to all Engliſhmen, but privately to you: as alſo that by vvay of exhortation, I might enflame you (being moſt vertuous Gentlemen) to ſtudy and follovv the contents of this booke, but eſpecially the artes and vertues therein publiſhed, &amp; almoſt in every vvord therof ſo highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; vvhich indeede is no other thing, than you doe alreadie. For the beholding of your anceſtors monuments of their vertues (vvhich are both many and famous) doth move you thereunto, more than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections drawne from all ages and examples here delivered. Therfore my deare friend <hi>Francis,</hi> amongſt ſo many notable examples of your realme, treade the ſteps of your unckle, the right honourable earle of Huntington, a man moſt admirable and iluſtrious, as well for godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and other noble vertues, as for noble parentage &amp; honour, rhat you mayſhew your ſelfe vvorthie of your place and kindred. And you good <hi>Edward,</hi> imitate the vviſedome, ſanctimonie, and integritie of your Father, the right Honourable Lord <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> keeper of broade Seale of England, a man right renowned; that you may lively expreſſe the image of your Fathers vertues, in the excellent tovvard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vvhich you naturally have from your moſt vertuous Father: If you both, do daily ruminate and remember the familiar &amp; beſt known examples of your anceſtors, you cannot have more forcible perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to moove you to that which is good and honeſt: But I vvill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pray God to proſper that good hope, vvhich your parents and kinſfolkes have of you, your good ſtudies alſo, and that he vvill plentifully bleſſe and beautifie you, with all the gifts of his ſpirit, that you may become profitable members of the Church, your countrie, and commonweale, and may live long and happie daies.</p>

                  </gap>gs. The one, when from the cauſes and Maximes, men come to knowledge of the effects and conſequences. The other, when contrarie, by the effects and conſequences wee come to know the cauſes and Maximes. As for example, when we ſee the earth waxe greene, and trees gather leaves, we know by that effect, that the ſunne (which is the cauſe thereof) approcheth nigh us: and we come to receive this Maxime, That the ſunne gives vigour and force unto the earth to bring forth fruits: And by the contrarie alſo, when we have knowledge of this cauſe and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Maxime, we come to know the effect, &amp; to conclude the conſequence; which is, That that ſunne comming nigh us, the earth bringeth foorth her fruits, and withdrawing from us, the earth leaveth to bring forth. The first of theſe two wayes is proper and peculiar unto the Mathematicians, which teach the truth of their Theoremes and Problemes by their demonstrations drawne from Maximes, which are common ſentences allowed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for true, by the common ſence and iudgement of all men. The ſecond way belongs to other ſciences, as to Naturall Philoſophie, Morall Philoſophie, Phyſicke, Law, Policie, and other Sciences, whereof the knowledge proceeds more commonly, by a reſolute order of effects to their cauſes, and from particulars to generall Maximes, than by the first way: although it is certaine, that ſometimes they alſo helpe themſelves, both with the one and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the other way.</p>
               <p>In the Politicke Art then (whereof <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and other Philoſophers have written bookes) men may well uſe both theſe wayes. For from the effects and particulars of a civile government, men may come to the knowledge of Maximes and rules: and by the contrarie, by the rules and Maximes, men may have the knowledge of effects. So that when we ſee the effects of a politicke government, which is of no value, and which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious and evill, men are hereby brought to the knowledge of the Maximes and rules which are of the ſame ſort: and by the good and profitable effects, men are alſo led to the notice of good rules and Maximes. And on the other ſide, good or evill rules and Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes do leade to the knowledge of like effects. Yet although the Maximes &amp; general rules

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of the Politicke Art, may ſomething ſerve to know well to guide and governe a publicke estate (whether it bee principalitie or free cittie:) yet can they not bee ſo certaine as the Maximes of the Mathematicians, but are rules rather very dangerous, yea, pernitious, if men cannot make them ſerve and apply them unto affaires, as they happen to come; and not to apply the affaires unto theſe Maximes and rules. For the circumſtances, dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, conſequences, and the antecedents of every affaire and particular buſineſse, are all for
<pb facs="tcp:21818:5"/>
the most part divers and contrarie: inſomuch, that although two affaires be like, yet muſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not men therefore conduct and determine them by one ſame rule or Maxime, becauſe of the diverſitie and difference of accidents and circumstances: For experience teacheth us, that in one ſame act, that which is good in one time, is not in another, but rather hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and that which is convenient for ſome nations, is not good for others; and ſo of other circumſtances. They then which deale in the affaires of publicke eſtate, had need to know not onely the Maximes and rules of the Politicke Art; but alſo they must have a wiſe, quicke, and ſharpe wit and iudgement, rightly and diſcreetly to ponder and weigh the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and accidents of every affaire, prudently to apply them to the rules and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, yea, ſometimes to force and bend them to ſerve to the preſent affaire. But this ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and habit of knowing well to weigh and examine the accidents and circumstances

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of affaires, and then to be able handſomely to apply unto them, their rules and principles, is a ſcience ſingular and excellent, but rare and not given to many perſons: For of neceſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Hereunto I anſwer, that nothing leſse and that it is not properly my purpoſe wherunto I tend, or for which cauſe I enterpriſe this Worke: But my intent and purpoſe is onely to ſhew, That <hi>Nicholas Machiavell,</hi> not long agoe a Secretarie of the Florentine commonweale (which is now a Dutchie) understood nothing or little in this Politicke ſcience whereof we ſpeake: and that he hath taken Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes and rules altogether wicked, and hath builded upon them, not a Politicke, but a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall ſcience. Behold here then the end and ſcope which I have propoſed unto my ſelf,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that is, to confute the doctrine of <hi>Machiavell;</hi> &amp; not exactly to handle the Politick ſcience; although I hope to touch ſome good points thereof in ſome places, when occaſion ſhall offer it ſelfe. Vnto my aforeſaid purpoſe I hope to come (by the helpe of God) with ſo proſperous a good wind and full ſailes, as all they which reade my writings, ſhall give their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and acknowledge, that <hi>Machiavell</hi> was altogether ignorant in that ſcience, &amp; that his ſcope and intent in his writings, is nothing els, but to frame a very true and perfect tyrannie. <hi>Machiavell</hi> alſo never had parts requiſit to know that ſcience. For, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertence in managing of affaires, he could have none; ſince during his time hee ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the brabblings and contentions of certaine Potentates of Italie, and certaine practiſes and policies of ſome cittizens of Florence. Neither had hee any or very little

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> knowledge in hyſtories, as ſhal be more particularly ſhewed in many places of our diſcourſe; where (God ayding) we will marke the plaine, and (as it were) palpable faults &amp; ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he hath committed in thoſe few hyſtories, which it pleaſeth him ſometimes by the way to touch: which alſo moſt commonly he alledgeth to evill purpoſe, and many times falſely. As for a firme and ſound iudgement, <hi>Machiavell</hi> alſo wanted, as is plainely ſeene by his abſurd and fooliſh reaſons, wherewith for the moſt part he confirmes his propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:21818:6"/>
and Maximes which he ſets downe: only he hath a certaine ſubtiltie (ſuch as it is)

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to give colour unto his moct wicked and damnable doctrines. But when a man comes ſomething nigh to examine his ſubtilties, then it truth it is diſcovered to be but a beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanitie and madneſſe, yea, full of extreame wickedneſſe. I doubt not, but many Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, which deale in matters of Eſtate, &amp; others of their humor, will find it very ſtrange, that I ſhould ſpeake in this ſort of their great Doctor <hi>Machiavell;</hi> whoſe bookes rightly may bee called, The French Courtiers <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they have them in ſo great eſtimation; imitating and obſerving his principles and Maximes, no more nor leſſe than the Turkes doe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of their great Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But yet I beſeech them not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that I ſpeake in this manner of a man, whom I will plainely ſhew to be full of all wickedneſſe, impietie, and ignorance, and to ſuſpend their iudgement, whether I ſay true

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> or no, untill they have wholly read theſe my diſcourſes: For as ſoone as they have read th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But to open and make eaſie the intelligence of that ſhould here be handled, wee muſt <note place="margin">

                  </note> firſt ſearch out, what that <hi>Machiavell</hi> was, and his writings. <hi>Machiavell</hi> then was in his time the Secretarie or common Notarie of the Common-weale of Florence, during the kingdome of <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, kings of France; <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, and <hi>Iulius</hi> the eleventh, Popes of Rome; and of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, kings of England: in which time hee writ his bookes in the Italian language,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and publiſhed them about the firſt beginning of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, king of Fraunce, as may be gathered by his owne writings. Of his life and death I can ſay nothing, neither did I, or vouchſafed I once to enquire thereof: becauſe his memorie deſerved better to be buried in perpetuall oblivion, than to be renewed amongst men. Yet I may well ſay, that if his life were like his doctrine (as is to be preſumed) there was never man in the world more contaminated and defiled with vices and wickedneſſe, than hee was. By the Praefaci he made unto his booke entituled <hi>De Principe, Of the Prince,</hi> it ſeemeth he was baniſhed and chaſed from Florence: For he there complaineth unto his Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall <hi>Lawrence de Medicis</hi> (unto whom he dedicated his Worke) of that hee endured iniuriouſly and uniuſtly, as he ſaid. And in certaine other places he reciteth, That one

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> while he remained in France, another time at Rome, and another while (not ſent embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour (for he would never have forgotten to have ſaid that) but as it is to be preſumed) as a fugitive and baniſhed man. But howſoever it be, he dedicates the ſaid booke unto the ſaid <hi>Lawrence de Medicis,</hi> to teach him the reaſons and meanes to invade and obtaine a principalitie: which booke for the moſt part containeth nothing but tyrannicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as ſhall appeare in the proſecution and progreſſe of this Worke. But I know not if they <hi>de Medicis</hi> have made their profit and taken uſe of <hi>Machiavels</hi> precepts, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his ſaid booke: yet this appeares plainely, that they (ſince that time) occupied the principalitie of Florence, and changed that Ariſtocraticall free estate of that cittie, into a Dutchie, or rather into a manifest tyrannie, as will eaſily appeare unto them,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which are advertiſed and have ſeene how Florence is at this day governed and ruled. Beſides this booke of a Prince or of a Principalitie, <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath alſo written three bookes, of diſcourſing upon the firſt Decade of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> with (ilustrating the other booke of Principalitie) is inſtead of a Commentary thereunto. Through all which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes hee diſperſeth heere and there a few words out of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> neither rehearſing the whole deede, nor hyſtorie of the matter, for which hee fiſheth theſe words, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:21818:6"/>
them prepoſterouſly, after his owne fantaſie, for the moſt part forcing them to ſerve

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to confirme ſome abſurde and ſtrange thing. Hee alſo mixeth heerewith examples of ſmall and pettie Potentates of Italy, happening in his time, or a little before, which are not worth the recitall, but are leſſe worthie to bee propoſed for imitation: Yet heerein is hee to bee excuſed, in that hee knew no better, for if hee had known: better, I doubt not but would have brought them to light, to have adorned his writings, and to have made them more authentike and receiveable. But out of thoſe two bookes, namely of Principalitie, and out of <hi>Machiavels</hi> diſcourſes, I have extracted and gathered, that which is properly his owne, and have reduced and brought it to certaine Maximes, which I have diſtinguiſhed into three parts, as may bee ſeene heereafter. And I have beene as it were conſtrained ſo to doe, that I might revocate and gather every matter to his certaine heade and place,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the end, the better to examine them: For <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath not handled every matter in one ſame place, but a little heere, and a little there, enterlacing and mixing ſome good things amongſt them, doing therin as poyſoners doe, which never caſt lumpes of porſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an heape, leaſt it bee perceived, but doe moſt ſubtillie incorporate it as they can, with ſome other delicate and daintie morſells: For if I had followed the order that hee houlds in his bookes, I muſt needes have handled one ſame point many times, yea confuſedly and not wholy: I have then drawne the greateſt part of his doctrine and of his documents, into certaine propoſitions and Maximes, and withall added the reaſons, wbereby he mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth them: I have alſo ſet downe the places of his bookes, to leade them thereunto, which deſire to try what fidelitie I have uſed, either in not attributing unto him any thing

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that is not his owne, or in not forgetting any reaſon that may make for him: wherein ſo much there wanteth, that I feare that any man may impoſe upon mee, to have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome fault therein: that contrarie, in ſome places I have better cleared and lightened his talke, reaſons and allegations, than they bee in his writings. And if any man ſay that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doe wrong him, in ſetting downe the evill things contained in his bookes, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the good things, which are diſperſedly mixed therewith, and might bring honour and grace unto him: I anſwere and will maintaine, that in all his writings, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any valew, that is his owne. Yet I confeſſe that there is ſome good places, drawne out of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> or ſome other authors, but beſides that they are not his, they are not by him handled fully, nor as they ſhould. For as I have aboveſaid, hee onely hath diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them amongſt his workes, to ſerve, as with an honny ſweet bait, to cover his porſon. And therefore ſeeing that that which is good in his writings, is taken from other better authors, where wee may learne them, better for our purpoſe, and more whole and perfect than in <hi>Machiavell,</hi> wee have no cauſe to attribute honour vnto him, nor to thanke him, for that which is not his, and which wee poſſeſſe and retaine from a better ſhop than his. And as for his precepts concerning the militarie art, wherewith hee dealeth in his bookes, which ſeeme to bee new, and of his owne invention, I will ſay nothing but that men doe not now practiſe them, neither are they thought worthie of obſervation, by them which are well ſeene in that art, as wee may ſee in that which hee maintaineth, <hi>That a prince ought not to have in his ſervice any ſtrange ſoldiors,</hi> nor to have any fortreſſes againſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> enemies, but onely againſt his ſubiects, when hee is in feare of them. For the contrary heereof is ordinarily ſeene practiſed, and in truth it ſheweth an exceeding great pride and raſhneſſe in <hi>Machiavell,</hi> that hee dare ſpeake and write of the affaires of warre, and preſcribe precepts and rules unto them which are of that profeſsion, ſeeing hee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by heare-ſay, and was himſelfe but a ſimple Secrethrie or Towne-clarke, which is a trade as far different from the profeſſion of warre, as an harquebuſh differs from a

When hee had thus ended his lecture and goodly diſputation, as <hi>Anniball</hi> went from the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, one of his friendes which brought him thither, demanded what hee thought of the philoſophers eloquence and gallant ſpeach? Hee ſaid; Truely I have ſeene in my life ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old dottards, but I never ſaw ſo great an one as this <hi>Phormio.</hi> So I doe not doubt but ſuch as have knowledge in the militarie art, will give the like iudgement of <hi>Machiavell,</hi>

But I leave things touching this matter, unto them which have more knowledge therein than I: for it is not my purpoſe, any thing to touche that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath handled of the militarie art, nor ſuch precepts as concerne the leading of an army.</p>
               <p>By this which wee have before ſpoken, That <hi>Machiavell</hi> was, during the raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, kings of France, and attained the beginning of <note place="margin">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> them the name of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> did but beginne to bee knowne on this ſide the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and his writings into ſome reputation. The anſwere heereunto, is not very obſcure to ſuch as know how the affaires of France have beene governed, ſince the deceaſe of king Henry the ſecond of happie memorie. For during his raigne, and before the kingdome was governed after the meere French manner, that is to ſay, following the traces and docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our French aunceſtors. But ſince, it hath governed by the rules of <hi>Machiavell</hi> the Florentine, as ſhall bee ſeene heereafter. Inſomuch that ſince that time, untill this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the name of <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath beene celebrated and eſteemed, as of the wiſeſt perſon of the world, and moſt cunning in the affaires of Eſtate, and his bookes held deareſt and moſt precious, by our Italian and Italionized courtiers, as if they were the bookes of <hi>Sibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſpeaking of that good king <hi>Lewis,</hi> &amp; rebuking him for giving ſuccours unto Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, that hee gives him the plaine lie, ſaying hee belyes himſelfe, having paſſed Italie at the Venetians requeſt, &amp; yet ſuccoured the Pope againſt his intention: And in other places hee calls our kings, Tributaries of the Suiſſes, and of the Engliſh men. And often when hee ſpeaketh of the Frenchmen, hee calleth them Barbarous, and ſaith, they are full of covetouſneſſe and diſloyaltie. So alſo hee taxeth the Almaignes of the ſame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now I beſeech you, is it not good reaſon, to make ſo great account of <hi>Machiavell</hi> in France? who ſo doth defame &amp; reproove the honour of our good kings, &amp; of all our whole nation, calling them Ignorant of the affaires of Eſtate, Barbarous, Covetous, Diſloyall: But all this might bee borne withall, and paſſed away in ſilence, if there were not another

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> evill. But when we ſee that <hi>Machiavell</hi> by his doctrine and documents, hath changed the good and ancient government of France, into a kind of Florentine government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we ſee with our eies, the totall ruine of all France: It infallibly followeth (if God by his grace doe not remedie it ſoone) that now it ſhould be time, if ever, to lay hand to the work, to remit and bring France againe, unto the government of our anceſtors.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I humbly pray the Princes and great lords of France, to conſider what is their duties in this caſe. Seemeth it (most Ilustrious Lords) ſeeing at this time poore France (which is your countrey and mother) ſo deſolate and torne in ſunder by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that you ought to ſuffer it to be lost and ruinated? Ought you to permit them to ſowe Atheiſme and Impietie in your countrey, and to ſet up ſchooles thereof? Seeing

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> your France hath alwaies been ſo Zealous in the Chriſtian Religion, as our ancient kings by their pietie and iuſtice, have obtained that ſo honourable a title and name of Moſt Chriſtian? Thinke you, that God hath cauſed you, to be borne into this world, to help to rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate your countrie, or coldly to ſtand ſtill and ſuffer your mother to be contaminated and defiled, with the contempt of God, with perfidie, with ſodomie, tyrannie, crueltie, thefts, ſtrange uſuries, and other deteſtable vices, which ſtrangers ſowe heere: But rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, God hath given you life, power, and authoritie, to take away ſuch infamies and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and if you do it not, you muſt make account for it, &amp; you can looke for but a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous &amp; iuſt puniſhment. If it be true, as the Civilian lawiers ſay, That he is a murderer, and culpable of death, which ſuffereth to die with hunger the perſon unto whom he oweth

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> nouriſhment; And ſhall not you be culpable before God, of ſo many maſſacres, murders, and deſolations of your poore France, if you give it not ſuccours, ſeeing you have the meanes, and that you are obliged thereunto by right of nature? Shall you not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and attainted of impietie, Athiſme, and tyrannie, if you drive not out of France, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavell,</hi> and his government?</p>
               <p>Heere if any man will inquire, how it appeareth, that France is at this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> governed by the doctrine of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> the reſolution heereof is eaſie and cleere. For the effects which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>France go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the doctrine of</hi> Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</note> we ſee with our eies, and the proviſions and executions of the affaires, which are put in practiſe, may eaſily bring us to the cauſes and Maximes, as we have aboveſaid: which is one way to know things, by aſcending from effects and conſequences, to the knowledge of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cauſes &amp; Maximes. And whoſoever alſo ſhall reade the Maximes of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> which we ſhall handle heereafter, and diſcend from thence into the particularities of the French government, hee ſhall ſee that the precepts and Maximes of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> are for the moſt part, at this day practiſed and put in effect and execution, from point to point: Inſomuch that by both the two wayes, from the Maximes to the effects, and from the effects to the Maximes, men may clearely know, that France is at this day governed by the doctrine of
<pb facs="tcp:21818:8"/>
                  <hi>Machiavell.</hi> For are they not Machiaveliſts, Italians or Italianized, which doe han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and deale with the ſeales of the kindgome of France? Is it not they alſo, which draw out and ſtampe Edicts? Which diſpatch all things within and without the realme? Which hould the goodlieſt governments and fermes belonging unto the Crowne? Tea, if a man will at this day obtaine or get any thing in the Court, for to have a good and quicke diſpatch thereof, hee muſt learne to ſpeake the Meſſereske language, becauſe theſe Meſſers will most willingly heare them in their owne tongue; and they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the French, no not the tearmes of iuſtice and Royall ordinances. Whereupon every man may coniecture and imagine how they can well obſerve or cauſe to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the lawes of France, the tearmes whereof they underſtand not. Moreover, plains ynough it is, That within theſe fifteene yeares, <hi>Machiavels</hi> books were as familiar and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ordinarie in the hands of the Courtiers, as the Breviaries are in the hands of Curates of pariſhes.</p>
               <p>And as for the diverſitie of auncient government (which was ruled in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the traces, faſhions, and cuſtomes of our aunceſtors) from the moderne and preſent government, which is founded upon the doctrine of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> it is eaſily and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſeene by the fruites and effects which doth proceed therefrom. For by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient French government, the kingdome was maintained and governed in peace and tranquilitie under the obſervation of auncient lawes, without any domeſticke or civile warre, flouriſhing and enioyning a free trafficke: and ſubiects were maintained in the poſseſsing and enioying of their goods, eſtates, franchiſes, and liberties. But now by the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Italian government of this time, the good and auncient lawes of the realme are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and ſuppreſſed; cruell warres and diſsentions are maintained in France; peace alwayes broken; the people destroyed and eaten, and trafficke decayed; ſubiects are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their auncient liberties and franchiſes, yea, and brought into ſuch confuſion and diſorder, that none knowes well what is his owne, and what is not; but one plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſoweth, and another moweth and reapeth the ſame. And although this be ſo true and manifeſt, that it ſhall not bee needfull to ſhew more amply, that the manner of our auncestors government was otherwiſe, and better than the moderne, which at this preſent is in uſe; yet for all that, I pretend hereafter upon every Maxime, clearely to demonstrate and by good examples, that our auncient Frenchmen guided and governed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> themſelves by good reaſon and wiſedome, cleane contrarie from the way of <hi>Machiavels</hi> precepts.</p>
               <p>Yet I meane not to authoriſe my ſayings by the allegation of examples of ſmall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates <note place="margin">Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are taken.</note> and tyrannizers borne in one night like toad-stooles (as <hi>Machiavell</hi> dooth) but by the allegations of gallant and notable examples of our kings of France, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and fortified, yea by other examples of good and auncient emperours, princes, and Romane captaines, and of the Senat of Rome. For I have choſen thoſe two Monarchies, the Romane and the French, as the fairest and most excellent, from whence to draw true and good examples which are worthie for a prince to imitate, borrowing but few from other precedent Monarchies, as Medes, Aſsyrians, and Grecians, as leſſe known

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> unto us, concerning the management and governement of their affaires, as too farre from our time, and from our manners and customes. I have lastly choſen the beſt and most authenticke Hystoriographers, and eſpecially, them which have written thoſe things which were and fell out in their owne time, and of thoſe affaires, the moſt part of which, they were ſpectators and actors. Of this ſort and order of mine owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Hystoriographers, were <hi>Froiſſart, Monſtrelet, de Comines, du Bellay:</hi> and of
<pb facs="tcp:21818:8"/>
Romanes, <hi>Saluſtius, Tacitus, Suetonius, Dion, Herodian, Lamptidius, Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                  <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> and certaine, which ſhall be alledged hereafter in their places. I alſo have drawne out ſome part of my allegations out of our Annales of France, out of <hi>Paulus Aemylius, Thucidides, Xenophon,</hi> and many other authours, all which are both authenticke and approoved, and that alſo, by preſcript of auncient time and long continuance have gained that praiſe and reputation, to bee good witneſſes, and that without reproch or diffamation. And for as much as <hi>Machiavell</hi> dare ſay, That the Frenchmen have no understanding or knowledge in matters or cauſes of Estate, I hope it ſhall appeare cleane contrarie, not onely by the good government which I ſhall ſhew to have been kept and obſerved by our auncestors in publicke cauſes, but alſo by the onely places and examples which I ſhall bring foorth and alledge out of <hi>M. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>

                  <hi>de Comines,</hi> Knight and Chamberlaine of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh: who lived even in <hi>Machiavels</hi> time, who alſo understood better how the affaires of a kingdome or Commonwealth ſhould be ruled or governed, than ever <hi>Machiavell</hi> knew how to guide and rule a ſimple towne. Yet I cannot but confeſſe, that for the governing and guiding of a tyrannous Estate, <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath more cunning, than any other of whom I have read; hee ſo well knewe all the points and precepts which were meete and convenient for the eſtabliſhing of it, as hereafter ſhall bee ſeene in the handling of his Maximes.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if in certaine places where the matter doth require it, I ſpeake a little <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſwers to the ſlanders of</hi> Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</note> too hardly of <hi>Machiavels</hi> Italian nation, I hope, that the good men of that countrey

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cannot finde it evill; as well becauſe <hi>Machiavell</hi> gives mee iuſt occaſion, having villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly and opprobriouſly ſlaundered in many ſorts our French nation, but alſo for that I intend not any thing to blame or reproove the good Italian people. And I will not denie, but that amongst the Italian and Florentine nation, there are diverſe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, which are nothing leſse than meere Machiavelists, and that detest and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre his wicked doctrine: For there is not ſo bad a ground, which amongst diverſe and ſundrie evill plants, bringeth not out ſome good. Yet will I give a particular praiſe and commendation unto ſuch Italians as bee vertuous, which better appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unto them, than unto the vertuous and goodly men of other nations: namely, that as precious ſtones and ſome other drougs and ſpices are esteemed to be most ſingular,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as they are most rare: ſo the good and vertuous Italians are ſo much the more to be praiſed and commended, becauſe they are rare, and for that it is no triviall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing in Italie to be a vertuous and good man. There is alſo another point which excuſeth mee, that is, That the force of the truth hath drawne and expreſſed this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> even that hee ſayth, That there is no nation or people in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, that is more vicious and corrupted than the Italian nation; and that there is no province nor kingdome, where there is leſſe care of God and of all Religion, than in Italie. Although as to this last point of Religion, <hi>Machiavell</hi> (which in all his bookes ſheweth himſelfe a very Atheiſt, and a contemner of all pietie and godlineſse) meant not to taxe nor blame them of his nation, of impietie nor of Atheiſme, but onely

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hereof, that they are not like the Paynims, which ſo ſcrupulouſly obſerve their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ceremonies, as wee ſhall more at large ſet downe in the ſecond part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>But from whence comes this impudencie unto <hi>Machiavell,</hi> to taxe and blame the Frenchmen of diſloyaltie and perfidie, ſeeing, that hee himſelfe alſo teacheth, That a Prince ought not to keepe and hould his faith, but for his profit and commoditie; and
<pb facs="tcp:21818:9"/>
that the obſervation of faith is pernitious and hurtfull. I will not denie, but that at

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this preſent time, many Italianized Frenchmen are diſloyall and faith-breakers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo learned by <hi>Machiavels</hi> doctrine: but I denie, that in the time of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> (during the reignes and governement of <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, and <hi>Francis</hi> the first, or before or long time after) the French nation was contaminated with that vice: as yet there are many good and naturall Frenchmen (thankes bee to God) which detest all perfidie and diſloyaltie, and are in no way affected to thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, which the Italians and Italianized doe in France; but rather doe ſobbe and ſigh in their hearts, for to ſee the French nation to be diffamed with that infamous and abhominable vice, detested and hated amongst all countries and nations. And I hope alſo, that the good and loyall Frenchmen will endevour themſelves to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the good renowne and reputation of the French nation, which ſome degenerated and Italianized, have defiled and polluted. But wherefore doth <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſo diffame and diſgrace the French nation for covetouſneſse? I doe much merveile at it: For untill this preſent time, the Frenchmen have alwayes had this reputation, to bee Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, Courteous, and readie to doe any pleaſure even unto ſtraungers, and ſuch as are unknowne unto them. And would to God, that the French nation had never been of that nature and condition, to doe well unto ſtraungers, without first knowing and trying their behaviours and manner of life: we ſhould not then ſee France to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and ruled by ſtrangers, as it is: We ſhould not feele the calamities and troubles of civile warres and diſſentions, which they doe enterpriſe there, to maintaine their

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> greatneſse and magnitude, and to fiſh in troubled water: The treaſures of France ſhould not bee ſo exhausted and drawne out, by their rapines and moſt inſatiable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, as they are. What countrey or nation is there in the world, that feelcth or can iustly complaine of the covetouſneſse of Frenchmen? Or rather, what nation is there, which hath not felt of the liberalitie of the kingdome of France. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, wee ſee with the eye and touch with the finger the covetouſneſſe and avarice of the Italians, which doe undermine and ruinate us, yea, which alſo doe ſucke out all our ſubſtance and wealth, and leaves us nothing at all for our ſelves. Some of them are Publicanes or Farmers of the kings revenewes or Farme-rents: Some, Farmers of the customes and fraights of marchandizes and carriages: Some, Farmers of yearely

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Tributes and Subſidies: and ſome, of the Princes private rents, yea, of all publicke and common profites belonging unto the French king, rating them even at what price they will: So that by that meanes, infinite coine comes into their hands, but there is but little which returneth againe to the publicke or common good of the Prince and countrey. Others obtaine great Estates, Offices, and Benefices, by the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all the treaſure and money of the kingdome of France fals into the hands of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And thoſe Italians, which have no meanes or occaſions thus to deale with the publicke affaires of the Commonwealth, doe hould and keepe bankes in good townes, where they exerciſe most exorbitant and unmeaſurable uſuries, by the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they doe wholly eat and conſume poore France, and bring it unto confuſion. And

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> although that in <hi>Machiavels</hi> time, France was not fallen into that extreame evill and great calamitie, as it is now at this preſent; yet ſince that time have wee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently felt the covetouſneſſe of the Italians, in the warres which our kings of France have made in Italie and Piedmont. For the great ſtore of treaſure and money that muſt needes have beene ſent beyond the Alpes, for to ſatisfie the inſatiable and greedie lusts of the Italians, was the cauſe oftentimes of encreaſing and raiſing imposts and
<pb facs="tcp:21818:9"/>
tallages upon the people, which by little and little did riſe ſo high, that they exceeded

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and doe exceede many times more than halfe the revenewe of the poore Plebeian, or common ſort of people. But this Italian covetouſneſse, which the Italians did exerciſe and uſe in the kingdome of France at that time, by their dealings for to draw our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and money into their owne countrey, was but honny, in reſpect of that which they have exerciſed, and doe ſtill exerciſe more and more, ſince that they have paſſed on this ſide the Alpes, and that they came to dominiere and pearch all over the country of France, and to hould and poſſeſſe Offices, Benefices, Fermes, Customes, Revenewes, and Bankes, as is heeretofore ſaid. And therefore it is clearely and evidently ſeene, that it is (as I may ſay) againſt the haire, that <hi>Machiavell</hi> and the other Italians dooth taxe the Frenchmen of Covetouſneſſe and Avarice. Vnleſse a man will ſay, that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Frenchmen are much to bee blamed and reprehended for Paſsive Avarice, which is in them, that is to ſay, which they ſuffer and endure of the Italians, who by their Active Covetouſneſſe (which they doe practiſe and put in action amongst us) doe clip the wooll on the backe, and ſucke our blood and ſubstance, as men do with ſheepe. And in this ſence to take it (as wee ſhould) it is certaine and aſsured, that <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avell</hi> blaming us of Paſsive Covetouſneſſe, which we do ſuffer, ſheweth us breefely, that wee are beastes, which will ſuffer our ſelves ſo to bee bereaved and weakened of our wooll and our blood (with patience) by ſtrangers. For it may well one day come to paſſe, that they may bee made to diſgorge their booties and rapines, and that their great heapes of money, gotten by extortions in France, may turne them unto damage:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> For as the Poet <hi>Sophocles</hi> ſayth:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Men muſt not ſeeke, nor love, of all things to get gaine,</l>
                  <l>For hee that draweth gaine out of that which is nought,</l>
                  <l>Before hee profit gets, ſhall ſooner loſſe ſuſtaine:</l>
                  <l>For evill gotten goods are often dearely bought.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And whereas <hi>Machiavell</hi> taxeth and chargeth the Almaignes with Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and perfidie, heerein may be ſeene, what an impudent and most wicked ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer hee is: For all men may plainely ſee, that (neither in their owne countrie, nor in the townes of France, where they dwell for their commerce and trafficke) they practiſe no great and execrable uſuries, as the Italians doe, but content themſelves with a meane and reaſonable profite for their money; as of five or eight at the moſt, for the loane and uſe of a hundreth: Whereas the Italians doe often returne their money with the gaine of fiftie, yea often of an hundreth, for an hundreth. And as for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and traffique, it is well knowne, that no other nation is more plaine, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſincere and loyall than they are, in their bargaines and trafficke: For they doe not refreſh, polliſh, and decke up their wares, nor doe change them and ſell one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they ſet not a price of their marchandize more than it is worth, but at the firſt word they aske, what at the laſt they will have, or not ſell it, without ſeeking any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable or extraordinarie profit, upon them which know not what the marchandize is worth. And as for perfidie, deceit, and treaſon, the Almaignes have them in ſo great execration and deteſtation, that they thinke, there neither is nor can bee any greater vice or ſinne than they are. Yea after a man once hath forfeated and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:21818:10"/>
in his Faith, contract, and promiſe, although but in ſmall things and of no great

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> reckoning or value, they will never afterward eſteeme or account him a good or honeſt man: So great (I ſay) is their deteſtation of all kinde of deceit and falſe dealing. But a man needs not mervaile, that <hi>Machiavell</hi> dare ſo impudentlie lye upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maignes, for hee hath brought forth more ſtrange things than this ſlaunder, as wee ſhall ſhew hereafter, both to the good of all others that ſhall reade his writings, and to the manifeſt and plaine laying open of him in his true and perfect colours: For the effecting whereof, let us then now enter into the matter.

But to veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that which I ſay, it is not needful to alledge many reaſons: for it is evident inough, That the felicitie of a publick eſtate, lieth wholly in well commanding, &amp; well obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whereupon reſulteth and ariſeth an harmonie and concordance ſo melodious and excellent, that as well he that commandeth, as he that obeieth, do both receive contentment, pleaſure, and utilitie. But to obey well, dependeth wholly of well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and it cannot be without it. So, well commanding dependeth of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and wiſdome of him that commandeth. Therefore the Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Spartianus in Seuero.</note> in warres, and his ſonne <hi>Baſsianus</hi> with him, and being caried in a Litter (becauſe he had the Gout) as he ſaw his ſoldiors diſcontented and mutinous, and would needs have <hi>Baſsianus</hi> his ſonne, their Cheefetaine; he cauſed all the Army, but eſpecially his Colonels, Captaines, and Corporals to be called, and to aſſemble in one place: and after having made unto them ſome Remonſtrance and Oration, hee cauſed ſtraight to be executed to death all the heads of that mutinie. After, he ſpoke thus to all the Armie, <q>Now know ye, that it is the head and not the feet which commandeth you. And indeed and truth, the good commanding proceeds from the prudence and wiſdome of him that commandeth:</q> which remaineth and hath his being not in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> feet nor armes, but in a brave mind, wel ſtaied and governed, which is aided and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with a good naturall towardneſſe, a mature and ripe age, and experience. And the Prince which can well command, ſhall alſo vndoubtedly be well obeyed. For a prudent commaundement draweth after it withall, an obedience: becauſe a wiſe Prince will alwayes adviſe to found his commandements in Reaſon and Iuſtice, and to the publicke utilitie, not to his owne pleaſure; by which meanes they that are to obey, ſhall as it were be conſtrained by the force of reaſon and equitie, and drawne alſo by the ſweetneſſe of the profit, to yeeld obedience. But if ſome by theſe meanes cannot be induced to obey (as there are alwayes ſome amongſt many) they will be brought thereunto either by the example of ſuch as let themſelves be overcome

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with reaſon and publicke utilitie, or els by puniſhment, which is in the Princes hand. He that will ſhew this by pluralitie of examples, That prudent Princes haue alwayes been well obeyed, and that their kingdomes and countries haue been happy, and full of all proſperitie; ſhould never haue done: but I will content my ſelfe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only two. <hi>Salomon</hi> was a King moſt wiſe, and a great Philoſopher: for he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wiſdome of God, and he gaue it him in ſuch abundance, that beſides that he was <note place="margin">1.

This his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wiſdome, made him ſo reſpected of all the great Kings, his neighbours,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that they eſteemed themſelues happie that they could doe him pleaſure, and might have his amitie: By this meanes hee maintained his kingdome in ſo high and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie a peace, that in his time, his ſubjects made no more account of ſilver than of ſtones, they had ſuch ſtore.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there a great diſcomfiture of people. By theſe two battailes loſt in Fraunce the one after the other, in a ſmall time, the kingdome was ſo debilitated of his forces and goods, as it could not ſtand: yet for a further heape of miſcheefes, at Paris, and in many other places of the realme, at the ſame time aroſe there many broiles and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile diſſentions. But that good King, <hi>Charles le Sage,</hi> was ſo wiſe and prudent in the conduction and government of the affaires of the realme, as well in the time that he was Dolphin and Regent of France (his Father being priſoner) as after when he was king, that by little and little hee laid to ſleepe all civile ſtirres and diſcords: after hee did ſo much, that he recovered upon the Engliſhmen almoſt all which they occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and although he was not ſo brave a warriour as his father king <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor as his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> grandfather King <hi>Philip,</hi> yet was he wiſer and better adviſed in his deliberations, not hazarding his affaires as they did (fearing to be reputed cowards) nor did any thing raſhly, without due conſideration. Hee tooke not arms in hand, but he knew well how and when to employ them to his good. Inſomuch, that K. <hi>Edward</hi> of England ſeeing the wiſdome of that king made his Armes rebound and become dull, and his victories and conqueſts to be loſt and annihilated: <q>Truly (ſaid he) I neuer knew king that leſſe uſeth Armes, yet troubleth me ſo much; he is all the day enditing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and hurteth me more with his miſſives, than ever did his Father or Grandfather with their great forces and Armes.</q> Behold the witneſſe which king <hi>Edward</hi> gave of the wiſdome of his enemie king <hi>Charles:</hi> which was yet of ſo great efficacie, that he

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> brought his kingdome into a good peace, by the meanes wherof his people became rich and wealthie, where before they were as poore and miſerable. And not only the people became rich, but the king alſo himſelfe heaped up great treaſures, which hee left to his ſonne after him: inſomuch, that he was not onely ſurnamed the Wife, but the Rich alſo. I could to this purpoſe adde here many other examples, but in a thing ſo cleare, the example of theſe two kings, <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> ſhall ſuffice: which two for their great wiſdome, have acquired the name of Wife: they both were rich in great treaſures, both of them maintained their ſubjects in peace, both left their kingdomes opulent and abundant, and placed the eſtates of their Commonwealths in great felicitie.

                     <p>It is a thing then plaine &amp; confeſſed, That it is an exceeding great good to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Prudence is more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, than in himſelfe.</note> when they have a Prince that is wiſe of himſelfe: but thereupon to inferre and ſay (as <hi>Machiavell</hi> doth) That the government of Prince ought to depend vpon his owne proper wiſdome, and that he cannot be well counſelled but by himſelfe; is evill concluded, and ſuch a concluſion is falſe, and of pernitious conſequence. For a Prince, how prudent ſoever he be, ought not ſo much to eſteeme of his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21818:12"/>
as to deſpiſe the counſell of other wiſe men. <hi>Salomon</hi> deſpiſed them not, and

                        <hi>Charles the wiſe</hi> alwaies conferred of his affaires with the wiſe men of his Counſell. And ſo farre is it off, that the Prince ought to deſpiſe anothers Counſell, that even he ought to conform his opinion to that of the men of his Counſell, which are wiſe, and ought not ſtubbornely to reſiſt their adviſe, but to follow it, and hold his owne for ſuſpected: And therefore that wiſe and cunning Emperour <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> the Philoſopher, being in his privie Counſell houſe (where was that great Lawyer <hi>Scaevola, Maetianus, Voluſianus,</hi> &amp; many other great perſons, excellent in knowledge, and honeſtie) after having well debated with them the matters they handled, when ſometimes he tooke in hand to ſuſtaine opinions contrarie to theirs. Well (ſaid he) maſters, The thing then muſt be done according to your adviſe: <q>For it is much more

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> reaſonable, that I alone follow the opinion of ſo good a number of my good and faithfull friends, as you are, than that ſo many wiſe men ſhould follow the opinion of me alone.</q> Vnto this opinion of the Emperor <hi>Antonius</hi> agreeth alſo the common Proverbe, That many eyes ſee clearer than one eye alone. Experience alſo teacheth vs, That things determined and reſolved by many braines, are alwayes wiſer, ſafer, &amp; better ordered, than the reſolutions of one alone. And we ſee alſo, that the ancient <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dioniſ. Halic. lib.</hi> 2.</note> Romanes, and all Commonweales, well governed, as well in times paſt, as at this day, have alwayes followed and obſerved that which by pluralitie of wiſe mens voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was concluded &amp; determined. And truly, ſo much the wiſer a Prince is, ſo much the more will he ſuſpect his owne opinion. For the ſame wiſedome which is in him,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> wil perſuade him not to beleeve himſelfe too much, and to have his own judgement for ſuſpected in his owne caſe (as all publicke affaires may be ſaid to be proper to the Prince) and to permit him to be governed by his Counſell. And contrarie, becauſe there are no people more preſumptuous, nor that thinke to know more, than they which know little; nor that thinkes to be more wiſe, than they that have no wiſdome: if you learne a Prince that thinketh himſelfe wiſe, this principle of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> That he ought to governe himſelfe by his owne wiſdome and Counſell, and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better counſelled than by himſelfe; you ſhall ſtreight find inconveniences: For then ſhal you ſee, that he will beleeve neither counſell nor adviſe, but that comes out of his owne head; and he will ſay to them that will give him any, That he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> well his owne matters, and that he knoweth what he hath to doe: and ſo will bring his eſtate and affaires into confuſion, and overthrow all upſide downe. And from whence comes this evill government and diſorder? Even from that goodly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> which willeth, That a Prince ſhould govern himſelfe by his own wiſedome; and that maintaineth, That a prince cannot be well counſelled, but by his owne wiſedome. The conſequence then of this <hi>Maxime,</hi> is not ſmall, ſeeing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke ſtate of a countrey may ſtagger and be overthrowne thereby. Better then it is, that contrarie, the Prince hold this reſolution, To govern himſelfe by good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and beleeve it, and have in ſuſpition his owne wiſedome. For if the Prince bee wiſe, and his opinion found to be founded upon Reaſon, they of his Counſell will

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> eaſily fall to his adviſe: ſeeing alſo, that oftentimes they applaud and like too well the Princes opinions, ſcant reaſonable. And wher. it happeneth, that they take the hardineſſe to contradict the Princes opinion, he ought euen then thereby to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade himſelfe, that he ſtrayeth farre from good reaſon, and in that caſe he ought to hold his judgement for ſuſpected. And contrarie, if the Prince be not wiſe at all (for it is not incompatible nor inconvenient, to be a Prince and to be vnwiſe withall) yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21818:12"/>
having this reſolution to governe himſelfe by Counſell, his affaires will carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> better, than being governed by the head. But in all caſes I preſuppoſe that the Princes Counſell is compounded of good and capable men, which have ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes the ſervice and utilitie of their Prince, which is no other thing but the Commonweale. For otherwiſe, if they be wicked, the Princes affaires cannot but goe evill, whether the Prince be wiſe or unwiſe. For that being wiſe, yet can hee not ſee nor know all, but onely conſidereth thoſe things which paſſe by the relation of his Counſellors. And if they of his Counſell bee wicked, they may alwayes ſo handle matters, that he ſhall not be advertiſed but of ſuch things as it pleaſe them, as ſoone falſe as true, to cauſe him to incline to their pleaſure and will. If the Prince be unwiſe, yet much better they of his Counſell (if they be wicked) may handle him

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at their devotion, and in all ſorts abuſe him.</p>
                     <p>And therefore have the Elders held this Maxime (cleane contrary to that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel)</hi> That it is more expedient to the Commonweale, that the Prince be wicked and his Counſell good, than that the Prince be good, and his Counſellors wicked. But for becauſe the Hyſtoriographer <hi>Lampridius</hi> hath touched that point very clearely and breefely, I will here recite and tranſlate his owne words: he ſaith then, in the life of the Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> addreſſing his ſpeech vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, in this manner. <q>Thou accuſtomeſt <hi>(Conſtantine</hi> the Great) to demand, What was the cauſe that <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> borne in Syria, hath been ſo excellent a Prince, ſeeing that even from the very Romane nation, and from

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the other Provinces, there have proceeded and come men wicked, impure, cruell, contemptible, unjuſt, &amp; given only to voluptuouſneſſe? I may firſt anſwer according to the common opinion of good men, That Nature (which is everywhere a Mother) may in all places &amp; in al nations engender a good Prince: I may alſo ſay, That <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was a good Prince by feare, for that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> his predeceſſor (which was a moſt wicked Prince) was maſſacred and ſlaine. And to touch the very truth, may it pleaſe thy pietie to remember that which thou haſt read in the Hiſtoriographer <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Maximus,</hi> That the eſtate of the Commonwealth is better and more aſſured, wherein the Prince is wicked, than that wherein the Princes Counſellors are wicked. For one wicked man may be well corrected by many good men; but many wicked

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> men cannot be ſurmounted by one good man alone. <hi>Alexander</hi> had Counſellors, which were venerable and holy perſons, not malitious, not theeves, not partiall, not cautelous, not conſenting to evill, not enemies to good men, not voluptuous, not cruell, not deceivers of their Prince, not mockers nor abuſers of him as a foole: but contrarie, perſons honorable, continent, religious, loving their Prince, which would not mocke him, nor be mocked of him, which in their eſtate were no ſellers, lyers, diſſemblers, and which defrauded not their prince of his honor, but loved him. They entertained not Eunuchs and flatterers, which ſerving for newes-carriers, oftentimes report otherwiſe than is ſaid unto them: and which hold their maſter ſhut up, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding above all things, that he ſhall know nothing of his owne affaires. I know

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                           <hi>(Conſtantine</hi> Emperor) that he brings himſelfe into great danger, which talketh to a Prince, that is a ſervant and a ſlave unto ſuch people: but thou which haſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the great miſcheefs that ſuch peſtilent flatterers bring, and how they deceive Princes, thou knoweſt how to debaſe and humble them, namely to force them only to deale with the affaires of the houſe, and not of the Commonweale. Above all, this is moſt memorable in <hi>Alexander,</hi> that hee would never receive any alone into
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21818:13"/>
his chamber, but the great maſter of his houſhold, and the great Lawyer <hi>Vlpian:</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> neither gave he any man libertie to ſell ſmoke, nor to ſlander or ſpeake evill of him: eſpecially after he had put to death <hi>Euxinus,</hi> who often had ſold him as a ſenceleſſe foole. There is more yet, that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſpared not his owne parents and friends when they deſerved puniſhment, or at the leaſt put them from him when they offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſaying, That he loved better the Commonwealth, than his parents and friends. And that thou maieſt know what people he had of his privie Counſell, theſe were they, <hi>Fabius Sabinus,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Sabinus,</hi> an excellent man, a ſecond <hi>Cato</hi> in his time; <hi>Domitius Vlpianus,</hi> a learned man and a Lawyer; <hi>Elius Gordianus,</hi> father of that <hi>Gordianus,</hi> which was after Emperour, a man very excellent; <hi>Iulius Paulus,</hi> a great perſon in the Law; <hi>Claudius Venatus,</hi> a great and worthy Oratour; <hi>Pomponius,</hi> a very

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> cunning man in the civile Law; <hi>Alfenus, Africanus, Florentinus, Martianus, Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus, Hermogenianus, Venuleius, Trifonius, Melianus, Celſus, Proculus, Modeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> all excellent Doctors of Law, and diſciples of that great Lawyer <hi>Papinian:</hi> all which were great familiers, and very privat with <hi>Alexander.</hi> More alſo he had of his privie Counſell, <hi>Catilius Severus,</hi> his Parent, as learned as any; <hi>Aelius Severianus,</hi> a perſon above all others, of greateſt ſanctitie; <hi>Quintilius Marcellus,</hi> of whom there is not found in hyſtorie a better man. <hi>Alexander</hi> then having all thoſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like of his privie Counſell, all which agreed to doe well, how could he then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe or thinke evill? Theſe Counſellors at the beginning were put from him out of credit, by evill Counſellors which abuſed <hi>Alexander,</hi> but afterward having wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> driven them from him, which were worth nothing, he called again his other good Counſellors, and loved all well. And theſe were they which made <hi>Alexander</hi> a good Prince: as contrarie, wicked Counſellors have made many Romane Emperours as wicked as they.</q> Behold then what <hi>Lampridius</hi> ſaith touching this queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is better to have a wicked Prince, which hath good Counſellors, or a good Prince which hath evill Counſellors: &amp; he reſolveth that the Elders have held, That it is much better to have a wicked Prince, which hath good Counſellors: which is contrarie vnto the new opinion of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> who makes no account of a Princes good Counſellors, if ſo be it the Prince himſelfe be good and prudent: who alſo ſaith, That the affaires of a Prince cannot be well conducted, vnleſſe he guide them

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> himſelfe by his owne wiſedome. It is then very clearely ſeene, that his <hi>Maxime</hi> is falſe by the alledged reaſons of <hi>Lampridius,</hi> namely, That many good Counſellors may well ſupplie the want of wiſedome that is in a Prince, and moderat his unbride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and undiſcreet appetites; but a good Prince cannot correct ſo many evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, which will feed their Prince with ſmoke and lies, and will hide from him ſuch things as he ought to know for the Commonweale.</p>

I will not here repeat the example of the Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> young came to the Empire, and under whom the affaires of the Commonwealth were well governed, by the meanes of good Counſellors, as is aboveſaid.</p>
                     <p>I may alſo here adde many other examples of our kings of Fraunce, which were not too ſpirituall, and yet governed well by their good Counſell. As alſo there were many Emperours of the Romane Empire, ſome ignorant and brutiſh, others volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and effeminate, others cruell, and knowing nothing but to handle yron. As were <hi>Philipus, Licinius, Diocleſianus, Maximianus, Carus, Carinus, Gallus, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Aurelianus, Galienus, Leon, Macrinus, Zeno, Iuſtintanus,</hi> and many others, which yet made very good Lawes, as wel for diſtributive juſtice, as for the pollicie of the Empire, as is ſeene by the Code of <hi>Iuſtinian;</hi> which lawes wee muſt needs attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to their wiſe and learned men, which were their Counſellors: for none of all them knew any thing, or little (except <hi>Macrinus)</hi> how to make good Lawes. Therfore I conclude this point againſt the Maxime of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> That a Prince may wel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne wiſely the Commonweale by the good counſell of good and faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, although he be evill provided of wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>But here remaineth a difficultie, which is not ſmall, How an unwiſe Prince may <note place="margin">Of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of good Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and Magiſtrats.</note> provide good and loyall Counſellors, ſeeing that Princes that are wiſe and well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, are therein often deceived. And upon this point I confeſſe there is nothing harder nor of greater conſequence to a Prince, than to guide himſelfe well in the election of ſuch perſons, whereof he ſhould compoſe his Counſell. For there are

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> great hypocriſies and diſſimulations, and one ſeemes to be a good man, ſincere, and continent, which ſhewes himſelfe another man, when meanes comes in his hand to corrupt vertue for to make his particular profit thereof. And we ſee but too much by experience, that the old Proverbe is true, <hi>Honours change manners.</hi> You may ſee how the moſt gracious and courteous in all the world, the moſt affable and offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every one (that is poſſible) whileſt they are in baſe degree; after they bee mounted into ſome high degree of honor &amp; dignitie, they become rough &amp; haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; ſo much, that to whom before they ſhewed themſelves facile and ſerviceable, they even ſeeme now not to know them, yea, which before were their privat friends and familiars: Such people have no good ſoules, but deſerve that their fierceneſſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and pride ſhould diſarſon and diſpoſſeſſe them of that place unto which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly their diſſembled humilitie and courteſie hath advanced them. This vice is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, not only in a Princes officers, but alſo in the Prince himſelfe, who ought not to put pride and fierceneſſe upon that head, whereupon the Crowne and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme ſtandeth. For hereof is the king <hi>Agamemnon</hi> taxed and reprehended by <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> his brother, in a Tragoedie of <hi>Euripides,</hi> where he ſayth thus:</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Most humble wast thou in times past, and kiſſed each mans hand,</l>
                        <l>Most humaine, gentle, affable, to none thy gates did ſtand</l>
                        <l>Shut up, to higheſt Honour thou (by ſuch means) ſoughtſt to riſe:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
                        </l>
                        <l>But now thou Honour hast ſupreme, why proov'ſt thou ſo unwiſe,</l>
                        <l>Another man ſtraight to become, and change thy manners all?</l>
                        <l>Yea humane dutie even to friends, by thee doth not befall.</l>
                        <l>To good men that esteems good fame, this is not covenable,</l>
                        <l>Chamoelion like thy manners changed, thou to be ſo mutable.</l>

This mutabilitie then, of manners which is ſeene in many natures of men, is the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cauſe that it is ſo hard for a Prince to know how to elect good men for his Counſel, and that in that point it is very uneaſie to teach a Prince how to behave himſelfe therein: yet I will a little diſcourſe upon that point, how the Elders governed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in election of Princes Counſellors, and then we will returne to <hi>Machiavell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Vpon this I firſt find, that our auncient Frenchmen have obſerved three rules, which I thinke good enough. The firſt, that the princes of the bloud are alwayes of the kings Counſell: for although it may well come to paſſe, that ſome one of them is not the moſt reſolute nor beſt garniſhed with parts requiſite to know well to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and govern the affaires of the Commonwealth; yet ſeeing they have that honor to be princes of the bloud, they may not be excluded, unleſſe it be for ſome great

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fault and offence: For ſo there may ariſe (as many times hath been ſeene) great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments, troubles, and partialities, which often draweth after them civile wars and infinit evils. The other rule is, that the new king retaine alwayes in his ſervice the old Counſellors of his predeceſſor, which governed well, eſpecially ſuch as have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acquired the reputation, to be good, loyall, and ſincere men. The third rule is, that the three eſtates provide good Counſellors for the king, during his minoritie, or if by accident he leeſe the uſe of his ſences or underſtanding: as was practiſed in both caſes during the raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, <hi>Ie bien aime.</hi> Which aforeſaid rules, as I hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>one can denie but they are good, and introducted with good reaſon by our anceſtors, ſo I muſt needs confeſſe that they are not ſufficient in all caſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> good Counſellors for a Prince. For it may well happen, that a prince of ful age may have few or no princes of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>loud experienced in affaires: and that the other Counſellors which his predeceſſor left, ſhall either not be good men, or not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or that they are dead, and therefore then he muſt needs come to an election of new Counſellors, by ſome other way than by theſe aforeſaid rules.</p>
                     <p>And upon that point it ſeemeth unto me, that the manner of proceeding, which <note place="margin">Lampri. in Alexandro.</note> 
                        <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the Emperour uſed to chuſe as well his Counſellors as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, is very good, &amp; meriteth well to be imitated and drawn into conſequence. For firſt, he never provided any perſons for an Office, in conſideration of any favour of kinred or amitie, nor in recompence of any ſervice, but onely in conſideration of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the probitie and capacitie of the perſons. But if any man were preſented unto him, which was not of good reputation, as well in know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>edge and experience, as in good life, although otherwiſe hee had done good ſervices in ſome other charge, or that there had been good appearance that he might doe well, being of the houſe &amp; race of wiſe and prudent people, yet he would not receive him. And the better to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the reputation of perſons, whereof he had profers by his wiſe friends, hee cauſed to be ſet up in common ſtreets and great publicke places, where many wayes meet, certaine poſts to fix bils upon them, whereupon was written certaine exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto the people, That if any man had any thing to ſay againſt ſuch and ſuch a man (which he named) wherefore they might not be received and admitted to ſuch

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and ſuch an Office, that he ſhould denounce it. And ſo made thoſe commaunds by placards, to the end he might better diſcover &amp; be advertiſed of the vertues &amp; vices of perſons. <q>For (ſaid this Paynim Emperor) ſeeing the Chriſtians uſe (well) this form, to renounce publickly in their aſſemblies the names of ſuch as they will promote unto the order of Prieſthood, why ſhould not we uſe it alſo in the election of our Officers and Magiſtrates, into the hands of whom we commit the lives and goods of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21818:15"/>
Moreover, he never ſuffered Offices and eſtates of Magiſtrates, which had

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> power &amp; authoritie over the people, to be ſold; nor that any commerce whatſoever ſhould be made of them: For (ſaid he) neceſſarily, he that buyeth, ſelleth; and if I ſuffer that any man buy an Office, I cannot condemne him when he ſelleth: for it were a ſhame for me to puniſh him which ſelleth againe that which he buyeth.</q> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, in the election of Counſellors and Magiſtrates, he did ever ſuſpect ſuch as fought for Offices, and held them for ambitious and dangerous people for the Commonweale. But they which he could know to be good men, and worthy of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke charge, and never ſought it, theſe were they which he eſteemed moſt ſufficient: and the more they excuſed themſelves from accepting of Offices, ſo much the more were they conſtrained unto them. Inſomuch, that one day there was one

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> (whereof there was good teſtimonie given unto him) unto whome hee determined the Office of Lieutenant Generall of Iuſtice in the towne of Rome: But the other excuſed himſelfe the beſt he could, ſaying, He perceived not himſelfe ſufficient nor capable to exerciſe ſo great an eſtate. The more he excuſed himſelfe, the more the Emperour <hi>Alexander</hi> conſtrained him, and commanded him to accept and exerciſe it, and that he would have it ſo, beeing contented with his ſufficiencie. The other, which in no caſe would accept that eſtate, found ſome light occaſion to get from the Emperours preſence for that time, and ſo fled. When the Emperour knew hee was fled, he cauſed him to be ſearched diligently, &amp; found him, cauſed him to be broght unto him, then he conſtrained him whether he would or no to accept that Office.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> He had alſo a good grace in the election of the Senators of the Senat: for he choſe not any, without demanding the adviſe of them which were already in that eſtate; and enquired of the maners, knowledge, and ſufficiencie of him or them which were to be Senators. And when it came to paſſe, that any man by his opinion did bring any into an Office, that was not in all points ſufficient, (as it often commeth to paſſe that they that favor a man, make his manners good, and his knowledge greater than it is) he thus puniſhed them, to bring them to the loweſt roume of all their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: which was a covenable and meet puniſhment: for he that by undue and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes will advaunce another, meriteth well to bee put from the place himſelfe.

                     </p>
                     <p>We find in our hyſtories of France, that our kings have ſometimes imitated this manner of proceeding of the Emperour <hi>Alexander,</hi> in his manner of election of Counſellors and Magiſtrates: For by auncient ordinances which lately were freſh in the publicke Counſell of Eſtates of Orleance (but ſince evill obſerved,) Offices ought to be conferred upon ſuch as were named to the king, by the other Officers and Magiſtrates, and by the Conſuls &amp; Preſidents of Townes and Provinces, which were to make true report of the life, good manners, and ſufficiencie of ſuch as they named. As for the vent and ſelling of Offices, it ſeemeth that it hath been long time tollerated in Fraunce. For <hi>M. Philip de Comines</hi> in his Hyſtorie which hee writ of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Comines, li.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</note> the life of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, ſaith, That alreadie in the time of that king (when

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he had warre againſt the lords of the Commonweale) in the yeare 1464, the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians made a great trafficke and commerce of Offices, whereof they are more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than any others of all the French nation: For (ſayth he) there are ſome which will give eight hundred skutes or crownes for an Office, that hath no wages nor ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend belonging unto it: and ſome will give for an Office that hath a ſtipend belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging unto it, more than fifteene yeares the ſtipend comes to. But it ſeemes unto me,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21818:15"/>
that <hi>de Comines</hi> toucheth not the white, when he ſpeakes of the cauſe why the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are ſo deſirous of Offices. For the true cauſe ſeemeth to be, for that by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of Paris, a father cannot beſtow upon one child more than upon another, be they daughters or ſonnes, unleſſe it be in Offices. And that therefore the Pariſians, which deſire to advantage any of his children above other (as commonly the father which hath many children, loves one more than another) are as it were conſtrained to buy Offices. And would to God that this cuſtome were yet to invent, and that the Pariſians had free diſpenſation of their goods, and that they had not brought in this villainous trafficke of Offices. But a ſtrange thing it is, which <hi>Comines</hi> addeth, That even in the time of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, the parliament of Paris maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that ſuch a commerce and trafficke was lawfull. But he ſpeakes not of what Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Court of Parliament tollerates that kind of trafficke. It is not credible, that at that time, Offices of judgement were ſold; nor that the Court of Parliament approved ſuch a commerce; but rather that they were Offices of Fines, Vſhers, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle keepers, Sergeants, Notaries, Offices of Waters, and Forreſts, and ſuch like, whereof the ſale was tollerable: but not of Offices of Preſidents, Counſellors, Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes, Stewards, Lieutenants, and other Offices of judgement. For it is ſeene by <note place="margin">Annales vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>An.</hi> 1499.</note> our Annales, that king <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth (who was called the Father of the people) to ſpare his people, and to pay the debts of king <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, his predeceſſor, and to helpe other great affaires which he had on his Arme for the recoverment of the Duchie of Millaine, he was the firſt king that began to ſell Offices Royall, excepting

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> alwayes the Offices of judgement, which he touched not. This was a very good king, and did this to a good end, to comfort and help his poore people from tallages and borrowings: Who conſidered, that it was as much and more reaſonable that hee ſhould take ſilver for ſuch Offices (which were not of judgement,) as privat perſons did, upon whom they were freely beſtowed; unto whom it was lawfull (as is ſaid) by a ſufferance alreadie inveterate of the ſaid Parliament, to ſell and trafficke them. But ſince, the fact of this good king hath been drawn into a conſequence and an uſe; yea, the exception of Offices of judgement is cleane alſo taken away, in ſuch ſort, that now al Offices indifferently are venall, yea, to him that offereth moſt to the laſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And although we may ſay ſtill, it is to the ſame end, namely to helpe the people,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yet it is evident, that that end is not ſought nor followed. For by the contrarie, the people is eaten up even to the bones, by theſe buyers of Offices, which will needs draw out of them the mony of that they bought. And it ſeemeth according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Emperor <hi>Alexander,</hi> that they have reaſon: for that which may be bought, may be ſold. As for the manner of election of the ſaid Emperour, whereby he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to eſtates ſuch as demaunded them not, before ſuch as ſought them, our kings have ſometimes uſed that alſo: as king <hi>Charles le Sage,</hi> when he gave the Office of Conſtable to that generous and valiant Knight <hi>Bertrand de Gueſclin.</hi> For <hi>de Gueſclin</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

Annales vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>An.</hi> 1402.</note> excuſed himſelfe the moſt that hee could in the world from accepting that eſtate, ſhewing him that he was a ſimple knight, &amp; that the Office of Conſtable is ſo great,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that he that will acquite himſelfe of that Office, ought rather to commaund great men, than them that were of low calling; and that he durſt not enterpriſe ſo much, as to commaund the brethren, couſins, and nephewes of his Majeſtie. But the king replied unto him: <hi>M. Bertrand,</hi> by this meanes excuſe not your ſelfe; for I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brother, Couſin, Nephew, Countie, nor Barron, in my kingdome, which ſhall not obey you with a good heart: and if any one doe otherwiſe, I will cauſe him to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21818:16"/>
know that it diſpleaſeth me: So that in the end <hi>de Gueſclyn</hi> accepted the Office, as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> conſtrained. After the death of this valiant Conſtable, king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, ſonne of the ſaid <hi>Charles le Sage,</hi> minding to give that Office to the Lord <hi>de Coucy,</hi> who was a brave and wiſe knight, and of a great houſe, and had performed great ſervices unto the Crowne of France, but he refuſed it, ſaying, that he was not capable for an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ſo great a burthen, and that <hi>M. Oliver de Clyſſon</hi> was more ſufficient than he to exerciſe that Eſtate, for he was valiant, bold, wiſe, and wel beloved of the people of warre. <hi>M. Oliver</hi> made the like refuſe, ſaying that the Lord <hi>de Coucy</hi> was much more worthie and capable than he. But after great ſtrife thereabouts, in the end, <hi>Oliver</hi> was conſtrained to accept that Office, wherein he acquited himſelfe well and like a wiſe and vertuous man. Likewiſe, after the death of this <hi>M. Lewis de Sancerre,</hi> Conſtable

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of France, the king would needs give that Office to <hi>M. Charles de Albret, Counte de Dreux,</hi> but he refuſed it many times, untill he was compelled to accept it. Where is now that modeſtie, to refuſe eſtates, &amp; to deferre them unto his companion? Where is that time, that men eſteemed not of honours, but ſuch as were gotten by true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Where is that happie world, when ambition was ſo baniſhed from great men? Where are now thoſe good, vertuous, and wiſe Princes, which gave no Eſtates and Offices, but to them which onely by vertue deſerved them; and that could make ſo good choiſe of fit perſons? Surely, we are come into the time of the Emperour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> (when the Empire began alreadie to decay) wherein Offices were not for Men, but for Riches: and to the time of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> (when the Commonweale was

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> altogether ruinated &amp; changed into another Eſtate) in which time alſo, Offices were not given, but for ambition, wealth, and unto ſuch as tooke part with ſuch great men as ſought to cary away the publick government. But I confeſſe, theſe examples which I have rehearſed, are but examples: but they may well ynough be Rules and Lawes, unleſſe we ſcorne to imitate that which <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who never gave Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as is ſaid, to importunat ambitious men, which ſought them, but to ſuch as were modeſt, and deſired them not; ſuch as <hi>de Gueſclyn, de Coucy, de Cliſſon,</hi> and <hi>de Albret:</hi> For they which accept them moſt hardly, are they which will acquite themſelves of them moſt valiantly and wiſely.</p>

For this diurnall motion, whereby the Sunne maketh an end of a naturall day from one morning to another, is admirable, ſwift, fearefull, and violent: and ſo is a ſoveraigne authoritie of it ſelfe, under which men tremble, and are diſmaied with fear and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But as we ſee, that the annuall motion of the Sunne, whereby he maketh an end

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> every yeare, oppoſeth it ſelfe againſt this violent and ſwift diurnall motion, yet not directly, but awrie, and as it were kiſſing and bending, drawing from the Weſt to the Eaſt, by the oblique and crooked circle of the Zodiake, &amp; by this means tempereth the rapacitie, violence, and ſwift diurnall motion, and by his pleaſantneſſe diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the ſeaſons of the Spring time, Summer, Autumne, and Winter, and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and maintaineth all living creatures, which otherwiſe cannot endure: even ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21818:16"/>
the prudence and wiſdome of Princes Counſellors, oppoſing themſelves pleaſantly

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and with a good grace by reaſon and equitie, againſt that ſoveraigne power, which of it ſelfe is fierce, redoubtable, and fearfull, it entertaineth and maintaineth publicke cauſes and the Commonwealth in good eſtate, which otherwiſe could not continue. Examples are ordinarily ſeene in Princes that are deſtitute of good Counſell: For ſtraight they abuſe their ſoveraigne power and authoritie, and degenerate it into a Tyrannie, indiſcreetly exerciſing violences, rapines, and injuſtice. And afterward men ſhall ſee it come to paſſe, that it cannot endure, but that they and their eſtate ſhall fall into ruine and confuſion. For it is a true Maxime, That no violence can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long.</p>
                     <p>Behold then a very great effect of good Counſell, that is, That it maintaineth the <note place="margin">Good Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell makes the Prince honoured.</note>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Prince in his Eſtate, and makes him to be obeied of his ſubjects: and again, as I may ſay reciprocally, it maintaineth his ſubjects in proſperitie under the obedience of the Prince. There is yet more, that is, That good Counſell obtaineth honour and good reputation to a Prince: For if a Prince be not wiſe of himſelfe, nor of great <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Comines, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 32 and 34.</note> capacitie, yet he ſhall be accounted wiſe, if he provide himſelfe good Counſellors. For it is commonly ſeene, that men attribute alwaies the effects of all things unto Princes, whether they be victories in warre which was conducted by wiſe Captains, or they be good rules, ordinances, and proviſions, which have been layed and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by wiſe Pollititians, his Counſellors: inſomuch, that the qualities &amp; conditions of Princes Counſellors are alwaies attributed unto him, becauſe of the effects which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ariſe thereof; which alwaies ſeeme to the people to proceed from him, by whoſe power and authoritie things are done. And withall, it is impoſſible, that the prince which is provided of good Counſellors, ſhould not ever learne with them, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day bee more and more cunning and ſufficient well to underſtand and governe his affaires (unleſſe he be exceeding dull and ſenceleſſe.) For how good Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors ſoever the Prince hath, yet muſt he not ſo much repoſe and truſt upon them, as he himſelfe will underſtand nothing of his owne affaires. Well to be allowed is the opinion of <hi>M. Philip de Comines,</hi> who ſaith, That God hath not eſtabliſhed the office of a Prince to be exerciſed upon brute beaſts, and to mocke and ſcorne them which ſpeake to them of any affaire; anſwering, I am no Clarke, I leave all to my

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Counſellors, in whom I truſt, and ſo go to their paſtimes: For (ſaith he) if they have been well nouriſhed in their youth, they will alledge other reaſons, and deſire that men ſhould eſteeme them wiſe and vertuous.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it is certaine, that the Prince which ſhall have the reputation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, <note place="margin">Good Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell makes the Prince feared and redouted. <hi>Titus Livius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Dec.</hi> 3.</note> to governe himſelfe by good Counſell, ſhall alwaies be the more feared and redouted both of his enemies and ſtrangers, and they ſhall not eaſily get any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon him. Thereupon it was, that <hi>Anniball,</hi> a prudent and valiant Captain, feared more the wiſe Captaines that were ſent againſt him by the Romans, than he did ſuch as were hardie and hazardous. And that the Romane forces were more feared and doubted of him, under the conduction of that wiſe Captaine <hi>Fabius</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                        <hi>Maximus,</hi> than under the other hardie and valiant Captaines. For when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes ſent againſt him the Captaines <hi>Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Sempronius,</hi> the one after the other, both of them generous and forward, and ſuch as deſired nothing more than the ſight, <hi>Anniball</hi> rejoyced thereat. And as he was prudent and hardie withall, he ſuffered them to take upon him ſome ſmall advantages, ſeeking ſtill to draw them unto ſome place of advantage, to fight with them, as indeed he did: They beeing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21818:17"/>
ſwelled, for that in ſome light skirmiſhes they had overthrowne ſome few of <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſouldiors, and thereby thought it was not honourable to recoile, and that men would think their hearts failed them to flie before ſuch as they had alreadie beaten, reſolved to give battaile; and indeed they gave it, but they loſt it to their great ſhame and confuſion. Which the Romane Senate ſeeing, ſent againſt <hi>Anniball, Fabius Maximus,</hi> who was not ſo forward (and it may bee not ſo hardie) in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing as <hi>Flaminius</hi> or <hi>Sempronius</hi> were; but he was more wiſe and carefull, as he ſhewed himſelfe. For at the firſt arrivall, as the other did, he did not aboord and ſet upon <hi>Anniball</hi> (who deſired no other thing) but began to coaſt him a farre off, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king alwayes advantageous places. And when <hi>Anniball</hi> approched him, then would he ſhew him a countenance fully determined to fight, yet alwaies ſeeking

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> places of advantage. But <hi>Anniball,</hi> which was not ſo raſh as to joine with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to his own diſadvantage, made a ſhew to recoile and flie, to draw him after him: <hi>Fabius</hi> followed him, but it was upon coaſts and hils, ſeeking alwayes not the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt way, but that way which was moſt for his advantage: inſomuch, as <hi>Anniball</hi> ſaw him alwaies upon ſome hill or coaſt nigh him, as it were a cloud over his head: ſo that after <hi>Anniball</hi> had many times aſſaied to draw <hi>Fabius</hi> into a place fit for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and where he might give battaile for his owne good, and yet could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto draw him, ſaid: <q>I ſee well now, that the Romanes alſo have gotten an <hi>Anniball:</hi> and I feare that this cloud, which approching vs, ſtill hovers upon thoſe hils, will ſome of theſe mornings poure out ſome ſhoure on our heads.</q> Breefely, the pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and wiſdome of <hi>Fabius</hi> brought more feare and gave more adoe unto <hi>Anniball,</hi> than all the Romane forces, which yet was not ſmall.</p>
                     <p>I have above recited another example, witneſſed of king <hi>Edward</hi> of England, who ſaid, That he feared more the miſſives and letters of king <hi>Charles le Sage,</hi> than he feared the great and puiſſant armies of 40 and 100000 men of his Father and Grandfather: and that wrought him more trouble, and broke more of his purpoſes and enterpriſes, in enditing of letters, than they ever did with their great forces. Which is another witneſſe made for prudence and good Counſell, like unto the example of <hi>Anniball:</hi> which witneſſes are ſo much the more worthie of credite, as the one proceeded from a moſt valiant king, and the other from a moſt noble and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> hardie Captaine; both which well knew by long uſe and experience, how to helpe themſelves with force and armes. And if we conſider the Romane hyſtories, we ſhall truly find, that the ancient Romanes made themſelves lords and maiſters almoſt of all the world, more by wiſdome and good Counſell, than by force: although they uſed both. Therefore, ſaid <hi>Varro,</hi> (as by a common proverbe received in his time) That the Romans vanquiſhed, ſitting: as if he would ſay: As they ſit in their chairs in their Senate, they provide ſo for their affaires by good Counſell and wiſedome, that they get and obtaine the upper hand in all their enterpriſes. Yea, and we ſee that at this day the Venetians maintain very well their eſtate, yea, do augment and make it greater, although they underſtand no thing how to handle armes: and indeed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> when they muſt needs goe to warre, they hire and wage people to doe it: but yet notwithſtanding are they wiſe and prudent, keeping themſelves as much as they can from the warre: and when they have warre, they do diſcreetly ſeeke meanes to quiet and appeaſe it by ſome other way than by battailes, beſiegings of Townes, or any other exploits of warre. And aſſuredly they know better how to finiſh and bring a warre to an end by their wiſedome and good Counſell, without ſtriking any ſtroke,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21818:17"/>
than many puiſſant princes by their forces and armes.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have ſpoken of a princes Counſell, which in the time of the Roman <note place="margin">A Senat, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, are things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> emperours men called, The princes Conſiſtorie; and our French, The kings Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie Counſell. But now we muſt know, that as well the Romane emperours as the kings of France of old, have yet had another Counſell whereunto they had recourſe in all their waightie affaires which were of great conſequence: as, when they ſtood in need to make lawes, ordinances, and rules, concerning the univerſall eſtate: the Romanes called this Counſell, the Senat; and the French call it, the Parlement. But this name of Parlement, aunciently ſignifieth an aſſemblie of the three eſtates, as <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> ſaith, and as is ſeene by all our French hyſtories. Our kings alſo <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Comines. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 64.</note> convocated ſometimes with their ordinarie and priuie Counſell, ſome good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of great Prelats and Barons of the realme, and that aſſemblie they called, The great Counſell. But afterward, men attributed the name of Parlement unto the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of Iudges and Senators, which judged cauſes and proceſſes, from whome there is no appeale. And ſome thinke that our Parlement is at this day like unto the Senat of Rome, but they are greatly deceived: for the Romane Senat tooke not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowledge of the proceſſes and cauſes of particular perſons, but only dealt with affairs of the State, of the univerſall government, and pollicie, and of matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence unto all the Commonwealth: and therefore the aſſemblie of the three eſtates in France, doe much better reſemble the Roman Senat than the Parlements doe at this day: which might better be compared unto the Romans Centumvirat,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or to their Praetorian government, which dealt in the knowledge of appellations, and matters of juſtice diſtributive, from which judgement ther was no appeale. And as the name of Parlement is at this day otherwiſe applied than it was anciently, ſo is it of the name of Great Counſell. But to come to our purpoſe. Wee read that the good Emperours never contemned or thought much, in waightie affairs to take the advice of the Romane Senat, and to governe themſelves thereby: for although that by the change of the eſtate which happened in the time of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> when the commonwealth was changed into a Monarchie, the authoritie of the Senate was much abated and weakened; yet there was never emperour found that durſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe altogether to aboliſh it: but contrarie, the good and wiſe emperors rather hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to eſtabliſh their authoritie and power. And the reaſon why no emperor, good or wicked, durſt enterpriſe to aboliſh the Senate, was, becauſe by the Law Roiall (whereby the eſtate Monarchicall was eſtabliſhed at Rome) there was only transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the king, the authoritie and power of the people, and not that which the Senat had. Which people, although they had ſovereigne power over every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon of the Senat, yet had they no power over the whole body of the Senat: for they might well puniſh with death one Senator, but they had no ſuperioritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the body of the Senat. So the body of the Senat, and the body of the People, were as it were alike and equall. And as much authoritie had the lawes of the Senat, which they called <hi>Senatus conſulta,</hi> as the lawes of the People, which they called

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                        <hi>Plebiſcita.</hi> And therefore the emperours which by the Law Roiall ſucceeded in the place of the People only (for the Senat did never deſpoile themſelves of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to inveſt the emperour therewith) had never power to decay the Senat, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durſt they ever enterpriſe it, although ſome had a will thereunto, as <hi>Nero, Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> and their like. But as for the good emperours, beſides that they had no power to aboliſh the Senat, they never had any deſire thereof, but maintained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21818:18"/>
it, and governed themſelves by it, and by it were they better obeied. For we

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> need not doubt but a people will more willingly obey a Law or Decree, which ſhall have been ſifted and examined in a great, wiſe and notable an aſſembly, ſuch as was the Senate, and will like it better, and rather judge the Law to be founded upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and equitie, than when it onely paſſeth through the braine of one ſole man, or of ſome ſmall number. Therefore the Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> never made <note place="margin">Lamp. in Alexand.</note> law nor edict, but he had on his Counſell twentie great and excellent Lawyers, and fiftie other great &amp; excellent perſons, wiſe and well experienced. And yet to the end that they might give their opinions more aſſuredly, he firſt made them underſtand the matter upon which they muſt give their adviſe, and after give time to conſider thereof, that their opinions might bee better digeſted &amp; reſolved. Therfore alſo the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ordained, that no law ſhould be availeable, unleſſe it were firſt <note place="margin">L. humanum C. de Leg.</note> concluded and determined with good and aſſured reſolution of all the princes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie, and afterward received and approved by the Senat of Rome. <q>For (ſaith he) we know well, that the ordinance of good Lawes and Edicts concluded with good Counſell and deliberation, is the eſtabliſhment of the aſſuredneſſe and glory of our Empire.</q> Therefore was it alſo, that that great and wiſe Emperour <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> did ſo communicate all the affaires of his Commonwealth with the Romane Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, <note place="margin">Dion in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</note> that as <hi>Dion</hi> ſaith, he made a ſweet and pleaſant mingled harmonie of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall eſtate, with the eſtate of the Commonwealth. And he not onely conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not himſelfe to conferre with the Senate all affaires of importance, and to take

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> their adviſe; but yet he would that the Senate ſhould give him every yeare twentie Counſellors to be nigh him, of his privie Councell: in which Counſell he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies many men very wiſe, courteous, and very modeſt, ſuch as the Lawyer <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and that good and prudent <hi>Agrippa</hi> his ſonne in law, with that ſo learned and good a piller of learned men <hi>Mecoenas.</hi> Therefore alſo <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, the ſucceſſor of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> although he was a Prince more abundant in vices than in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, not daring wholly to ſtray out of his predeceſſors traces (that good <hi>Auguſtus,)</hi> made nor ordained any thing of weight without the Counſell and adviſe of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. For this cauſe alſo (breefely) all the good Emperors, as <hi>Veſpatian, Titus, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, Adrian,</hi> the <hi>Antonines,</hi> and others like, communicated alwaies with the Senate

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> upon all the great affaires of the Commonwealth; and they bore themſelves not like maiſters, but like Preſidents of the Senat: alſo they did not attribute unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any title of honour, nor enterpriſed to make any triumphs, but ſuch as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and ordained by the Senate. And by the contrarie, the Emperours which were of no account, ſuch as <hi>Caligula, Nero, Comodus, Baſsianus, Maximinus, Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus,</hi> and other like, hated extreamely the Senate, eſteeming of it as their pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge and corrector; and have cauſed many Senators to die, thinking the more eaſily to command as they would, having no controulers to withſtand their wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the end was alwayes this, that ſuch as deſpiſed and would have annihilated the Senate, have ever had an unluckie end, and reigned not long time, but have all

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> been maſſacred and ſlaine young, and have left unto their poſteritie an infamie and moſt wicked memorie of them. Herein is ſhewed a continuall ſucceſſe of the juſt judgements of God againſt them which deſpiſed wiſe Counſell: and contrary, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie and divine proſperitie in other Emperours, which governed themſelves by the good Counſell of the Senate, and of the wiſe men of their privie Counſell: For they raigned and held the Empire happily repleniſhed with all goods, honour, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21818:18"/>
glorie, and their ſubjects under them enjoyed good handling, and good repoſe and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> tranquilitie. And we need not doubt that ſuch felicitie comming to good Princes, the evill haps unto wicked Princes, doe not proceed from God: for as the wiſe man ſaith: Good Counſell commeth from God, and he that deſpiſeth the gift of God, <note place="margin">Prov. 18. Eccle. 37.</note> certaine it is, that in the end he ſhall be well chaſtiſed.</p>
                     <p>Our kings of France of old, uſed the ſame courſe that theſe good Emperors did: For they often convocated the three Eſtates of the kingdome, to have their adviſe and Counſell in affaires of great conſequence, which touched the intereſt of the Commonwealth. And it is ſeene by our Hyſtories, that the generall aſſembly of the Eſtates was commonly done for three cauſes: One, when there was a queſtion <note place="margin">In old time the general Eſtates wer held for three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> to provide for the kingdome, a Governour or Regent; as when kings were young, or

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had not the uſe of their underſtandings by ſome accident, or were captives or priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: For in theſe caſes the three Eſtates aſſembled to obtaine a Governour for the Realme. Againe, when there was cauſe to reforme the kingdome, to correct the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes of Officers and Magiſtrates, and to bring things unto their ancient and firſt inſtitution and integritie: For kings cauſed the Eſtates to aſſemble; becauſe that many being aſſembled from all parts of the kingdome, they might better be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of all abuſes and evill behaviours committed therein, and might alſo better worke the means to remedie them: becauſe commonly, There is no better Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, than he that knoweth well the diſeaſe, and the cauſes therof. The third cauſe why there was made an aſſembly of the Eſtates, was, when there was a neceſſary cauſe to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> lay a Tribute or Impoſt upon the people: For then in a full aſſembly, ſome ſhewed to them which were there (which repreſented all the people) the neceſſitie of the kings and the kingdomes affaires, who graciouſly and courteouſly entreated the people to aid and helpe the king but with ſo much money as they themſelves thought to be ſufficient and neceſſarie. And for this cauſe, that which the Eſtates accorded to the king, was called with theſe gracious names, Subſidies, Subventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Aydes, Grants: not with theſe tearmes, Tailles, Impoſts, Tributes, Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which were tearmes more hard and odious. Examples appeare of the firſt cauſe, when the generall Eſtates aſſembled at Paris, after the death of king <hi>Charles le Sage,</hi> to provide for the government as well of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, being under <note place="margin">Annal. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on An 1380 and <hi>Froſſ. li</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 58. &amp; 60.</note>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> age, as of the kingdome: which government they gave unto three of the kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: namely, to the Duke of Berry, Languedoc, to the Duke of Bourgoigne, Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and Normandie, and to the Duke <hi>de Aniou:</hi> the remainder of all the realme, and the rule of the young kings perſon was committed to the ſaid Dukes of Berry and Bourgoigne.

                     <p>In like manner the generall Eſtates were held at Tours after the deceaſe of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, to purvey for the government of king <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, under <note place="margin">Annal. up<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on An. 148. and <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And by the ſame Eſtates was eſtabliſhed a Counſell of twelve perſons, good men and of good calling, to diſpatch the affaires of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; yet in the kings name, and under his authoritie. And the rule of the young

                     <p>When king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt <hi>le bien aime,</hi> was come to the age of one and twentie yeares, his uncles were diſcharged from the government of the kingdome, by the <note place="margin">

And there it was ordained, that all accountants for the kings revenues and rents ſhould make their accounts. By the meanes of which reformation, great ſummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were recovered upon the ſame accountants, and there were alſo made ſome good lawes and ordinances. In other conventions of Eſtates, the money and coine hath been reformed from weake and light, unto thicke and of good waight and goodneſſe. Alſo of late at the generall Eſtates held at Orleans, were made manie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> goodly ordinances for the good and comfort of the poore people, reformation of juſtice, and for the cutting off of manie abuſes which were committed in plaies at Cardes and Diſe, in ſuperfluitie of apparell, and in matter of benefices.

                     <p>As for the laſt cauſe for which we haue ſaid the generall Eſtates in old time were called, namely for the graunt of Helps &amp; Subſidies; ther are manie examples in our Hiſtories.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> part of the kingdome. And after he was taken priſoner and led into England, the ſaid Eſtates agreed to give vnto <hi>Monſieur le Dauphin</hi> his ſoune, great ſummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to pay for the ſaid kings raunſome, and for <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonne, being alſo a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And well to be marked it is, that our hiſtories doe witneſſe, that all the people of France generally, were meruailouſly anguiſhed &amp; grieved with the priſonment &amp; captivitie which they ſaw their king ſuffer, but eſpecially the people of the countrey of Languedoc: For the Eſtates of the ſaid countrey ordained, that if the king were not delivered within a yeare, that every one, both men and women, ſhould lay by all coloured garments, ſuch alſo as were jagged and cut, and ſuch as were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with gold, ſilver, or other ſtrange and coſtly faſhion: Likewiſe, to make

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ceaſe all ſtage-plaies, morriſdauncings, piping, yea and plaies, paſtimes and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; in ſigne and token of their mourning and lamentation for their princes cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie. A thing whereby appeared the great and cordiall affection of this people towards their king. As truely the Frenchmen have alwaies been of great love and affection towards their kings, unleſſe they were altogither tyrants. But to make an end of this point: Certaine it is, that before king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh called <hi>le Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorieux,</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:21818:19"/>
no Subſidies were impoſed, without aſſembling the generall Eſtates. And

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that our kings uſed thus to do, was not becauſe they had power by an abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to impoſe tallages and ſubſidies, without calling the Eſtates: but it is to the end they may be better obeyed with a voluntarie and unconſtrained obedience, and to ſhunne all uprores and rebellions which often happen upon that occaſion. And truly, the French people have alwaies been ſo good and obedient unto their kings, that they never refuſed him any thing, if there were but any appearance of reaſon to demand it. Yea often the Eſtates have granted their king more than he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or durſt looke for: as is ſeene by that which our hiſtories write of the Eſtates held for Subſidies.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe Aydes and Subſidies were cuſtomably granted for the making of <note place="margin">

Philip de Comin.</hi> ſaith, That kings ſhould alſo communicat and conſult with their Eſtates, whether the cauſes of ſuch warres be juſt and reaſonable; and that the Prince cannot nor ought not otherwiſe to enterpriſe a warre: For it is reaſon that they which defray the charges and expenſes, ſhould know ſomething. But yet he paſſeth further, and ſaith: There is no Prince in the world which hath power to lay one pennie upon his ſubjects without their grant and conſent, unleſſe he will uſe tyrannie and violence. But becauſe at the firſt they which reade this place of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> may peradventure thinke that he ſeemes too much to limit and reſtraine a Princes power, I will here as it were by an interpretation of his ſaying, a little cleare this point.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt then underſtand and preſuppoſe, that in a ſoveraigne Prince, there <note place="margin">A Prince hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, an abſolute and a civile.</note> are two powers: the one is called an abſolute power, and the other a civile power. The abſolute power, is that which cannot nor ought not to be any thing limited, but ſtretcheth it ſelfe to all things whatſoever they be, unleſſe it be to the lawes of God and of nature, and of thoſe lawes which are the foundation of the principalitie and eſtate: For a Prince hath not power over God, no more than the vaſſall hath over his liege Lord, but ought himſelfe to obey his commandements and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: So much there wants that he can any thing aboliſh or derogate from them.</p>
                     <p>The Prince alſo cannot aboliſh the fundamentall lawes of his principalitie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his eſtate is founded, and without which his ſaid eſtate cannot ſubſiſt nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: for ſo might he aboliſh and ruinate himſelfe. As in France the king cannot aboliſh the Salicke law, nor the three eſtates, nor the law of not alienating the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and provinces united to the crowne. For the Realme and the Royaltie are founded upon thoſe three points; which are as three pillars, that ſuſtaine and hold up both the king and kingdome: neither can the Prince breake nor aboliſh any law naturall, approved by the common ſence of all men. But in all other things, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power of a Prince reacheth without limitation; for it is above all other lawes which he may make and unmake at his pleaſure: he hath power alſo over the body and goods of his ſubjects, without reſtriction, purely and ſimply. True it is, that he

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ought to temperat the uſe of that Abſolute power, by the moderation of his ſecond power, which is Civile; as we ſhall ſay hereafter. But ſuppoſe he will not moderate his abſolute power by the Civile, we muſt notwithſtanding obey, becauſe God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us. But before we ſpeake of the Civile power, we muſt a little more amply cleare the points before touched.</p>
                     <p>The firſt point then, which is, that the Abſolute power of a Prince ſtretcheth not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21818:20"/>
above God, is a matter of all confeſſed: And there were never found any Princes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> (or very few) which would ſoare and mount ſo high, as to enterpriſe upon that which belonged unto God, yea, even the Emperours <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> are blamed and deteſted by the Paynim hyſtories, which had no true knowledge of God, for that they durſt enterpriſe upon God, and upon that which appertained unto him. Alſo it is a Maxime in Theologie, That we muſt rather obey God than men: which Maxime hath at all times ben practiſed by all good people and holy perſons (which are praiſed even with the mouth of God in the holy Scriptures) as by <hi>Daniell</hi> and his companions, the Apoſtles, the Chriſtians of the primitive Church, and many of our time.</p>
                     <p>As for the other point, which is, that the Prince cannot aboliſh the foundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <note place="margin">The Prince cannot abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes of his principality</note>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> lawes of his principalitie, it is as cleare of it ſelfe. For if a Prince overthroweth the foundations of his principalitie, he ruinateth and overthroweth himſelfe, and his eſtate cannot endure: for the firſt ſenceleſſe and unwiſe man that comes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, will overthrow all upſide downe. As if in Fraunce a king may overthrow the Salicke law, and ſo ſubject his Crowne unto the ſucceſſion of women, it is certaine, that long ago the eſtate of France had been overthrowne. For kings which have left none but daughters after them (as <hi>Philip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>le long, Charles le bel,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth) had been eaſily enclined upon naturall affection towards their daughters, to have broken that Salicke law (if they ſo could) to cauſe the Crowne to have falne unto their ſaid daughters; by the meanes whereof, the kingdome after ſhould have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> falne into ſtrangers hands, and by conſequent into ruine and diſſipation. For the nature of the inhabitants of France is ſuch, that they cannot long ſuffer a ſtrange Prince (wherein they differ from many other nations) as they could not long beare the domination of the Romane Emperours: but againſt the reigne of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Tiberius</hi> they began to kicke, and be greeved with the rule of Princes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation than their owne: and finally, they rid themſelves of the Romanes yoke, and Gaule was the firſt Province that cut it ſelfe from the Empire. Neither was there ever found king that durſt enterpriſe to breake the Salicke law. True it is, that king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, at the inſtigation of <hi>Philip</hi> duke of Bourgoigne, gave the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of France in dowrie with his daughter <hi>Katherine,</hi> which he maried to the king

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of England, and declared the Dolphin unable and incapable to ſucceed in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Fraunce; becauſe at Monterean-fante-Yonne, <hi>Iohn,</hi> father of the ſaid <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> duke of Bourgoigne, was by him ſlaine. But this donation held not, as being made againſt the Salicke law: inſomuch, that the ſaid duke <hi>Philip</hi> himſelfe (which had procured and cauſed to declare the ſaid Dauphin unable to be king of France) after the death of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, acknowledged him for king and lawfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to the Crowne of Fraunce. For as for incapacitie, it was knowne there was none, becauſe that duke <hi>Iohn,</hi> which the Dauphin had ſlaine, deſerved it well, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before cauſed to be ſlaine the duke of Orleance the kings only brother. Yet becauſe the manner of the execution which the ſaid Dauphin cauſed to be made

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> upon the ſaid duke <hi>Iohn,</hi> was not by lawfull meanes, he acknowledged his fault in that caſe, and made a great ſatisfaction to the ſaid duke <hi>Philip,</hi> as ſhall hereafter be more at large ſet forth. So then the Salicke law hath alwaies remained firme, as one of the three pillars of the kingdome and royaltie of France, our anceſtors neverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to ſuffer women to raigne and rule over them.</p>
                     <p>As much is to be ſaid of the Eſtates generall, the authoritie of which hath alwaies
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21818:20"/>
remained whole, untill this preſent, even from the foundation of the kingdome, as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> being the ſecond piller whereupon the kingdome is founded. For if it happen that the crowne fall to a king under age, or to one that is not well in his wit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or that the king be a priſoner or captive, or that the kingdome have urgent neceſsitie of a generall reformation: how neceſſarie is it in all theſe caſes, that the eſtates aſſemble to provide for all affairs, otherwiſe the eſtate of the kingdome and of the Roialtie would incontinent fall to the ground? and without doubt it could not long continue in his being, if the generall eſtates were aboliſhed and ſuppreſſed. For to ſay that in the aforeſayd caſes, other than the foreſaid eſtates may well order the affairs of the realm, as the princes of the blood, and the kings Counſell, is to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: becauſe it may ſo come to paſſe, that the princes themſelves be under age, or

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> priſoners, or captives, or witleſſe, or ſuſpected, or dead, or otherwiſe uncapable: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it may come to paſſe that the kings Counſell ſhall be dead, or quaſhed, or ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or otherwiſe unable, ſo that the eſtate of the kingdome and the Roialtie ſhall be evill founded and aſſured upon ſuch foundations and leaning ſtocks. But the body of the eſtates Generall, is a body not ſubject to minoritie, captivitie, percluſion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſuſpition, nor other incapacitie, neither is it mortall: therefore is it a more certaine and firme foundation of the kingdomes and Roialties eſtate than any other. For the body of the Ewates (which is a body compoſed of the wiſeſt &amp; fitteſt of the kingdome) can never faile, becauſe it conſiſteth not in <hi>Individuis</hi> and certain perticular perſons, but it ſtandeth in <hi>Specie,</hi> being a body immortal (as al the French

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nation is immortall.) The Princes, &amp; the kings Counſellors, are but fraile &amp; brittle leaning ſtocks and means, ſubject to incapacitie: ſo is not the body of the Eſtates: and therefore the Eſtates being the true and perpetuall foundation to ſuſtaine and conſerve the kingdome, cannot be aboliſhed, but ought to be convocated whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is to be a proviſion in the caſes above mentioned. Withall alſo, Reaſon willeth that the Eſtates (whom the affairs of the realme toucheth moſt) ſhould have a part in the conduction of publike things, but moſt eſpecially in the caſes aforeſaid, where the king cannot order them. Therefore is it a ſtrange, damnable, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious poſition which our ſtrangers that governe France at this day, dare impudently hold, That it is treaſon to ſpeake of holding the Eſtates. But contrary, a man may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſay, That it is treaſon to aboliſh the Eſtates: and that they which wil hinder that they ſhall not be held in the caſes aforeſaid (but eſpecially for the reformation more than neceſſarie of ſo many abuſes as theſe ſtrangers haue brought into Fraunce) are themſelves culpable of treaſon; being ſuch as doe overthrow and ruinat the Realm, the Roialtie, and the King, in taking away the principall piller which ſuſtained them. And truly ſuch people do merit, that proceſſes and indictions ſhould be laid upon them as upon the enemies of the Commonwealth, which doe ſubvert &amp; overthrow the foundations upon which our Aunceſtors have with great wiſdome founded and eſtabliſhed the eſtate of this goodly and excellent kingdome.</p>
                     <p>The like may we ſay of the Law, whereby the lands and provinces united to the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Crowne of Fraunce, are inalienable: For a king of France cannot aboliſh that Law, becauſe it is the third piller upon which the realme and his eſtate is founded. For proofe hereof, I will alleage but two examples, the one was practiſed in the time of <hi>Charls le ſage,</hi> king of Fraunce, and the other in the time of king <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, of happie and late memorie: By which two examples may appeare, not onely that this law of, Not alienating the lands of the Crowne, is a pillar of the kingdome: but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21818:21"/>
alſo that the Eſtates are as the very and true baſſe and foundation thereof.

                     </p>
                     <p>King <hi>Iohn</hi> having been taken priſoner at the battaile of Poiters, was conducted <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Froiſſ. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 201, 211, 212, 214, 246, 247, 310.</note> into England: where he made treatie of peace with king <hi>Edward</hi> of England. But the eſtates of the kingdome which were aſſembled, would not agree unto that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as too prejudiciall, and to the diminution of the Crowne of France. King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> was ſo angry and deſpited thereat, that he made a great oth that he would end the ruinating of Fraunce. And indeed whileſt king <hi>Iohn</hi> was his priſoner, he paſſed over the ſea, and made great warre in France, and much waſted the flat Countrey, but he made no great conqueſt of the Townes. In the end the Duke of Lancaſter counſelled him to make peace with the French, ſhewing him that he did but leeſe time ſo to run over the fields, and ſpoile the champion countrey, and ſouldiers only

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> had the profit, and he himſelfe loſſe of people and expences. Theſe reaſons could not much move the king to make peace, he was ſo ſore offended and animated. But God, who had pitie of this poore kingdome (which was in extreame deſolation and confuſion) wrought and brought to paſſe, as it were by miracle, a peace; ſending from heaven a tempeſt, accompanied with lightening, ſo great, over the campe of the Engliſh, that they thought that heaven &amp; earth would have met, and the world have finiſhed; for ſo great ſtones fell with the tempeſt, that they overthrew men and horſes. Then the king of England ſeeing God fight againſt him, being in a great fear and diſtreſſe, made a vow unto God, That if by his grace he eſcaped from that peril, he would hearken unto peace, and would ceaſe to ſaccage and deſtroy the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> as indeed he did after the tempeſt ſeaſed. Which peace yet was accorded, to his ſo great advantage, that thereby beſides the ranſome of three millions of franks Guienne remained unto him in ſoveraigntie; alſo the countrey of Armignac, de Albret, de Comines, de la Marche, de Santongeois, Rochellois, and a good part of Languedoc, which before never was in the peaceable obedience &amp; domination of Engliſh. Vnto this peace (which was concluded in a village called Bretigni, nigh to Chartres) the French ſubjects of that countrey would not in any ſort agree nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend: but refuſed to obey and yeeld themſelves Engliſh. For their reaſons they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, That the king had no power to diſmember and alienate them from the Crowne of France; and that therupon they had priviledges from king <hi>Charlemaine,</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> whereby they could not, nor ought not to be cut off from the truncke and houſe of France. After that they had long debated &amp; refuſed to obey, the king <hi>Iohn</hi> (who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good hoſtages was returned into Fraunce) ſent into his countries <hi>M. Iames de Bourbon</hi> his couſin, and a Prince of his bloud, to make them obey the Engliſh: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that whether they would or no, thoſe good French ſubjects ſhould forſake the French obedience, and be under the Engliſh governement. This could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great greefe of heart, ſadneſſe, and incredible diſpleaſure. But above all others, moſt remarkable for great conſtancie, were they of Rochell, to remaine French: for they many times excuſed themſelves unto the king, and ſtood ſtiffe more than a <note place="margin">Rochellois good Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men.</note> yeare, before they would let the Engliſhmen into the towne. And thinking that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> their excuſes and remonſtrances might ſtand in ſome ſtead, they ſent to the king their Orators: which arriving at Paris, and being brought before the king, fell at his feet with weepings, ſobbings, and lamentations, making this ſpeech. <q>Moſt deare ſir, your poore and deſolate ſubjects of your towne of Rochell, have ſent us hither to beſeech your Majeſtie in all humilitie, and with joined hands, that it would pleaſe you to have pitie and compaſſion upon them.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> (moſt deare Sir) in the name of God, and of all his Saints, that you will not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forſake us: but that it would pleaſe your clemencie and kindneſſe to retaine for your ſubjects, moſt humble, them which cannot live but in al vexation, languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bitterneſſe of heart, unleſſe we be your ſubjects.</q> The king having heard the piteous ſupplication of theſe poor Rochellois, mourned and pitied them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but he made them anſwere, That there was no remedie, that which he had accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, muſt needs be executed. This anſwere being reported at Rochell, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeake what lamentations there were through all the Towne; this newes was ſo hard, that they which were born &amp; nouriſhed French, ſhould be no more French, but become Engliſh. Finally, they being preſſed &amp; conſtrained by the kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to open the Towne-gates to the Engliſh: <q>Well (ſaid the moſt notable townſmen) ſeeing we are forced to bow under the yoke, and that it pleaſeth the king our ſoveraigne lord, that we ſhould obey the Engliſh, we will with our lips, but our hearts ſhall remaine alwaies French.</q> After that the Engliſh had been peaceable poſſeſſors of Rochell, and all the other countries abovenamed, king <hi>Edward</hi> inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his eldeſt ſonne the prince of Wales, in that government, (a valiant and very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21818:22"/>
humble Prince towards greater than himſelfe, but haughtie and proud towards his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> inferiors) who came and held his traine and court at Bourdeaux, where having dwelt certaine yeares, he would needs have impoſed upon the countrey a yearely tribute of money upon every fire. But to withſtand this new impoſt and tribute, the Lords, Barons, and Counties of thoſe countries, but eſpeciall the Countie <hi>d' Armignac, de Perigourd, de Albret, de Commenges,</hi> and many others, all which went to Paris to offer in their appeales againſt the Prince of Wales: Arriving there, they dealt with king <hi>Charles le Sage</hi> (for king <hi>Iohn</hi> was then dead) about their appeale; who anſwered them, That by the peace of Britaine, which he himſelfe had ſworne the dead king his father for him and his ſucceſſors to the Crowne, had acquited and renounced all the ſoveraignetie of the ſaid countries, and that he could not with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> breake the peace with the Engliſh, and that it greeved him much, that with good reaſon he could not accord their appeale. The ſaid Counties and Barons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, ſhewed him by lively reaſons, That it is not in the kings power to releaſe &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the ſoveraigne power and authoritie of his ſubjects and countries, without the conſent of the Prelats, Barons, Cities, and good Townes of thoſe Countries; and that was never ſeene nor practiſed in France, and that if they had been called to the treatie of Britaine, they would never have conſented unto that acquittance of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie. And therefore humbly praied his Majeſtie to receive their appellation, and to ſend an huiſher to adjorne in caſe of appeale, the Prince of Wales to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at Paris at the Court of Fraunce, to the end to quaſh and revoke the ſaid new

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ordinance for the ſaid tribute. Finally, the king <hi>Charles</hi> was nothing offended to heare them ſo ſpeake of a kings power (much unlike our <hi>Machiavelistes</hi> at this day which call them culpable of treaſon, which ſpeake of Eſtates) neither replied unto them, that the power of a ſoveraigne Prince ought not to be limited, neither that they ſpoke evill to revoke into doubt that which his dead father had done: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, rejoycing at that limitation, referred the cauſe to the debating and reſolution of the wiſe men of his Counſell. And after he was reſolved, that it was true which they ſaid, he accorded unto theſe Counties and Barons their demaund, and ſent to adjorne in caſe of appeale to the Court of Paris, the Prince of Wales: which done, the ſaid Counties and Barons eaſily revolted from the Engliſh obedience: ſo did

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Rochell get all Engliſhmen out of their towne and caſtle. This done, the duke of Berry, the kings brother, would have entred there; but for that time with good words they refuſed him the entrie thereinto, ſaying, they would ſend unto the king certain Delegates, to obtaine ſome priviledges, and therefore deſired of the duke a ſafe-conduct, which he willingly granted: and having the ſame, they ſent twelve choſen for that purpoſe amongſt their Burgeſſes, which finding the king at Paris, ſhewed him in all humilitie, how of themſelves they were rid of the Engliſh obedience, and that again they would remit themſelves into his Majeſties obedience, as being their king and naturall ſoveraigne Prince, but that they beſought him humbly to accord <note place="margin">Priviledges of Rochell.</note> them certaine priviledges. The king demanded, what priviledges. Firſt, ſaid they,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> That it would pleaſe your Majeſtie to agree unto us, that the Towne of Rochell may be inſeparably united unto the Crowne of France, ſo that it may never be ſeperated nor diſmembred, by peace, mariage, nor by any compact, condition, or miſadven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that can come in Fraunce: Secondly, that the Caſtle may be throwne to the earth, without which, we will keepe the towne of Rochell well for your Majeſtie. The king perceiving their demands, and finding them reaſonable, and proceeding from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21818:22"/>
a true French heart, accorded their requeſts: and ſo the Rochellois returned meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> into the French obedience, from whence they had been ſeperated to their great greefe. Here then you ſee how well to the purpoſe and to the great profit of the king and of the kingdome, that law of not alienating the Lands, Townes, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Crowne, was made. But upon this that I have ſaid of the Rochellois, ſome Meſſer will ſay: How happeneth it then, that the Rochellois are at this day ſo bad French ſubjects? hereunto the anſwere is eaſie and evident, that is, that they are at this day as good Frenchmen, as ever were the anceſtours, but they are not good Italians, neither meane to be ſubject under the yoke of ſtrangers, no more than their anceſtors. Let us now come to the other example.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that name, being priſoner at Madril in Spain, in power of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fiſt, there was made a traitie and an accord betwixt the two great princes; whereby amongſt other things, the king promiſed the emperor, to grant him all his right and poſſeſſion of the Dutchie of Burgoigne, and that he would imploy himſelfe to cauſe the Eſtates of the countrey to condiſcend therunto. This accord being concluded, the emperor cauſed the king to be conducted to Bayonne, and there by his embaſſadours ſummoned him to ratifie the accord which he had made at Madril when he was priſoner, to the end to make more vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and that it might the rather appeare to be made without conſtraint; unto which embaſſadours the king anſwered; that he could doe nothing in that article concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Dutchie of Burgoigne without firſt knowing the intent and will of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> becauſe he could not aliene it without their conſent, and that he would cauſe the Eſtates of the countrey to aſſemble to know their wils therein. Not long after the king cauſed the Eſtates of Burgoigne to come together, which would by no meanes conſent unto the ſaid alienation: whereof hee advertiſed the emperour, who ſeeing that by reaſon they could not be alienated without their conſents, was content with that anſwer; upon this condition: That the king would aſſure the ſaid Dutchie unto the firſt heire male which the ſaid king ſhould have by <hi>Elenor</hi> the ſaid emperours ſiſter, unto whom he was then eſpouſed: ſo that, that law (That the king cannot alienate the Crowne-land) was then verie profitable unto the king and the kingdome. And unto this agree the doctors of the Civill law, which hold; that the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> emperour cannot aliene any thing of the Empires, but he is bound to increaſe it to his power. And from thence they drawe (but fooliſhly) the etymologie of that name <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſaying: The Emperors are called <hi>Auguſti,</hi> for that they ought to encreaſe, and cannot diminiſh the Empire: as much ſay they of other kings and monarchs, for there is therein the like reaſon.</p>
                     <p>For a concluſion, no man of perfect judgment can denie, but theſe three lawes of the kingdome of France, namely, the law Salicke; the law of the Eſtates general; and the law of not alienating the lands and provinces of the crowne, are the verie true pillars, baſes, and foundations of the kingdome and the royaltie, which none can or ought to aboliſh. I doubt not but there will be found manie, which will be

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> quarelling at thoſe aforeſaid examples and reaſons: and will ſay: That to ſuſtain and defend that the king cannot aboliſh the ſaid lawe, is to diminiſh his power, and to give limitation and reſtriction to his ſoveraigne authoritie. But for reply, I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demaund: If it be not puiſſance in a prince to conſerve him and his eſtate? If they confeſſe yea (as none can denie it, if he be not altogether without judgement:) I ſay, it followeth by argument taken from contraries, that it is then impuiſſance and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21818:23"/>
want of power in a prince, to ruinate himſelfe and his eſtate. And by conſequent it

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> followeth, that when we ſay that a Prince cannot aboliſh the fundamentall lawes of him and his eſtate; ſo much there wanteth that we diminiſh his power, that by the contrarie we eſtabliſh it and make it more firme, greater, and as it were invincible. As alſo on the contrarie, they which ſay, that a Prince can aboliſh and change his lawes, upon which he and his Eſtate are founded; they eſtabliſh and place in him an impuiſſance to conſerve himſelfe. For to take it rightly and in good ſence, it is an act of impuiſſance, to ruinat, deſtroy, overthrow, and to participate his eſtate: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, it is an act of power to conſerve himſelfe, and maintaine his eſtate. No more nor no leſſe, than when a building falleth upon the earth, or when a man letteth it fall, theſe be acts of feebleneſſe, frailetie, and impuiſſance: but when the one and the other holdeth and ſtandeth ſtreight and firme, without cracking or falling, theſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> be acts of force and power.</p>
                     <p>As for the law Naturall, it cannot be aboliſhed: For if a Prince will authoriſe, <note place="margin">The law naturall ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the king, or any other.</note> adulteries, inceſts, thefts, murders, and maſſacres, and other like crimes, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon and common ſence cauſeth us to abhorre and deteſt: certaine and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that ſuch authoriſing is of no value, and that the Prince cannot doe this. When the emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> wold eſpouſe <hi>Agrippina,</hi> his niece, his brothers daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he made a Law, whereby he authoriſed the mariage of the uncle with the niece, which was publiſhed all over: but ſayth <hi>Suetonius,</hi> no man would imitate and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Emperours example (but a bad ſervant newly enfranchiſed, and a ſouldier,)

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> every body ſo deteſted and abhorred ſuch kind of mariages, as being contrarie to the naturall law and common ſence. And indeed, this mariage fell not out well for <note place="margin">

We read likewiſe, that the Emperour <hi>Baſsianus Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Spartian. in Carac.</note> beholding one day <hi>Iulia</hi> his mother in law with an eye of inceſtuous concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> She ſaid unto him, <hi>Si tu le veux, tu le peux.</hi> If thou wilt, thou maieſt; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not that it belongs unto thee to give the law, not to receive it? which talke ſo enflamed him yet more with luſt, that he tooke her to wife in marriage. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hyſtoriographers note, that if <hi>Baſsianus</hi> had knowne well, what it was to give a law, he would have deteſted and prohibited ſuch inceſtuous and abhominable copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and not to have authoriſed them. For breefely, a Prince may well give lawes unto his ſubjects, but it muſt not be contrary to nature and naturall reaſon. This was the cauſe why <hi>Papinian</hi> the great Lawyer (who well underſtood both naturall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile law) loved better to die, than to obey the ſaid Emperor <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to excuſe before the Senate his parricide, committed in the perſon of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
                        <hi>Geta</hi> his brother. For <hi>Papinian</hi> knowing, that ſuch a crime was againſt natural right, ſo much there wanted, that he would have obeied the Emperor, if he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to have perpetrated and committed it, that he would not obey him ſo far therein, as to excuſe it. Wherein the Paynim Lawyer may ſerve for a goodly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to condemne many Magiſtrate Lawyers of our time, which not only excuſe, but alſo cauſe to be executed unnaturall murders and maſſacres againſt all law divine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21818:23"/>
and humane. But now we have ſpoken of a Princes abſolute power, let us come to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the other.</p>
                     <p>The other power, which we call Civile, is that which is governed and as it were <note place="margin">The Civile power tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateth the Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</note> limited within the bounds of Reaſon, of right, and equitie, and which we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that the Prince will uſe, and uſeth ordinarily in all his commaunds: unleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſely he ſhew and declare, that he willeth and ordaineth this or that of his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power and of his certaine knowledge. This is that ſecond power, which is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by prudence and good Counſell: and which giveth a ſweet temperature and counterpoiſe to that abſolute power, no more nor no leſſe, than the ſecond motion of the Sunne tempereth the courſe of the firſt, as we have aboveſaid. This is that power which eſtabliſheth and conſerveth in aſſuredneſſe, kingdomes and empiers,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and without which they cannot ſtand, but incontinent ſhal be ruinated, annihilated, and laid on the ground. This is that power which all good Princes have ſo practiſed, (letting their abſolute power ceaſe without uſing any, unleſſe in a demonſtration of Majeſtie, to make their Eſtate more venerable and better obeyed) that in all their actions and in all their commands they deſire to ſubject and ſubmit themſelves to lawes and to reaſon. And in this doing they never thought or eſteemed to doe any thing unworthie of their Majeſtie, but contrary, have ever accounted, that there was no thing more beſeeming the majeſtie of a ſoveraigne Prince, than to live and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie himſelfe in all his actions according to right and equitie. And that the domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and power of a Prince, that ſo governeth himſelfe, is greater, more ſecure and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> more venerable, than his, which governeth himſelfe after the abſolute power. And truly, all the good Romane Emperours have alwayes held this language, and have ſo practiſed their power, as we read in their hyſtories. Yea, the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">L. digna Vox. C. de Lege.</note> made an expreſſe law for it, which is ſo good to be marked, that I thought good to tranſlate it word by word. <q>It is the majeſtie of him that governeth, to confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be bound unto lawes, ſo much doth our authoritie depend upon law. And aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, it is a farre greater thing than the Empire it ſelfe, to ſubmit his Empire and power unto lawes. And that which we will not to be lawfull unto us, we ſhew it unto others by the oracle of this our preſent Edict. Given at Ravenna the eleventh day of Iune, the yeare of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Florentius</hi> and <hi>Dioniſius.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>To come then to our purpoſe, you muſt underſtand, that <hi>de Comines</hi> ſpoke of this ſecond power in the place above alledged, and not of the abſolute power of a Prince: for by that power it is certain, that the Prince hath good authority to enterpriſe wars, &amp; to levie impoſts upon his ſubjects without their conſent. Becauſe that by the roiall law above mentioned, the Roman people gave all the like power unto the Prince, as <note place="margin">Dion de Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We ſee alſo by the law of God the ſame abſolute power is given unto kings &amp; ſoveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For it is written, that they ſhall have full power over the goods &amp; perſons of their ſubjects. And althogh God have given them that abſolute power, as to his miniſters <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.</note>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> &amp; lieutenants on earth, yet wold he not have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> uſe it, but with a temperance &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſecond power, which is ruled by reaſon &amp; equitie, which we call Civile. For, ſo much there wanteth, that God would that Princes ſhold uſe the ſaid abſolute power upon their ſubjects, as he wold not ſo far conſtrain them, as to ſell their goods, as is declared unto us in the example of <hi>Naboth.</hi> For moſt unlikely is it, that God <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 22.</note> the great Dominator and Governor of al Princes, would have Princes to abuſe their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21818:24"/>
powers with cruelties, rapines, injuſtices, or any other unreaſonable way of abſolute

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> power. But as God by juſtice puniſheth the wicked, and by kindneſſe and clemencie maintaineth the good, and rightly and moſt holily uſeth his divine power; ſo would he, that Princes which are his lieutenants on earth, ſhould do the like; not in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (for that they cannot) but in imitation.</p>
                     <p>To conclude then now our talke, concerning the place of <hi>Comines,</hi> certaine it is, that a Prince may well make warre, and impoſe tallies without the conſent of his ſubjects, by an abſolute power: but better it is for him to uſe his civile power, ſo ſhuld he be better obeyed. And as for Aydes and Subſidies, whereof <hi>Comines</hi> ſpeaketh, ſome ſay they are not at this day levied by an abſolute power, but by the peoples conſent. Becauſe in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh (who had great and long warres

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> againſt the Engliſh) the Eſtates generall of the kingdome agreed unto him to levie Aydes and Subſidies every yeare, without any more calling them together; for that the warres endured ſo long, and that their every yeares aſſembly would have come to great expences: ſo that if the cauſe had alwaies continued, then neceſſarily ſhuld the impoſition have continued. But certaine it is, that this conſent, delivered by the ſaid Eſtates, concerned only the Engliſh warres, which ending, the ſaid conſent fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: yet afterward, the ſaid conſent and accord of the Eſtates was drawne into a cuſtome. In the time of king <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, the Eſtates generall at Tours, were convocated, as well to provide for the government of the king and of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (for his majeſtie was under age) as alſo for Aydes and Subſidies; which were

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> freely graunted by the ſaid Eſtates, although the people of Fraunce were then very poore and ruinated. And the abovenamed <hi>Comines</hi> ſheweth one thing that is very true, That the holding of the ſaid Eſtates is very good and profitable for a king of France, whereby he is both ſtronger and better obeyed: but he complaines, That in his time there were men (as there are at this day) unworthie to poſſeſſe thoſe offices which they held, who all they could hindered the holding of the Eſtates, leaſt their evill behaviors and incapacities ſhould be eſpied and knowne. Such men are of like humors, as the unworthie Emperours <hi>Caligula, Maximinius, Commodus,</hi> &amp; others, whereof we have ſpoken above: which hated the Senat of Rome, becauſe they would not have ſuch correctors and controulers.

                     <p>Let us now come to <hi>Machiavell,</hi> to proove his Maxime, which we have aboue <note place="margin">The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is better than the counſell of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He alleadgeth two reaſons: The one is, that if a Prince governe himſelfe by one Counſell alone, it would proove dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, for feare that the Counſellor ſeeke to occupie the Eſtate. Whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that that were conſiderable, if principalities were at this day given by tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie elections of ſouldiers, as in times paſt the Romane Empire was given: for he that could obtaine the favour of the men of warre either by love or money, carried it away. But in our time, principalities are hereditarie, or are given by grave and deliberate election of more ſtaid and diſcreet people, than were the Praetorian ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Rome. Yet doe not I approove that a Prince ſhould be governed by one

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> alone, when he may have a greater number of good Counſellors: for they that have ſo done in times paſt, have found it evill, and have repented it, as more fully ſhall be ſhewed in the next Maxime. The reaſon alſo is evident, becauſe one alone cannot ſo well by his wiſdome examine and ſearch out a matter or cauſe, nor ſo well can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent difficulties, occurrents, &amp; conſequents that may happen, as many can do. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> approveth the counſell which is compounded of many.</p>

The other ſecond reaſon of <hi>Machiavell</hi> is, that he ſaith, That in a Counſell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

                        <note place="margin">Diſcordant opinions comming to one end, is not to be feared.</note> of many, there are alwaies diſcordances and contrarieties of opinions that they cannot accord. Whereunto I anſwer, That if a Counſell be compounded of good and fit men, they will alwaies ſufficiently agree in their opinions (as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſheweth it in the Counſels of many Princes, and in the body of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales) although they diſagree in motives, reaſons, allegations, and in other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Theſe diſcordances are often very profitable and neceſſarie, if ſo be they all looke to one end, which is the good of the Commonwealth. As happened in the Counſell of the Senate, which was held at Rome about that horrible and ſtraunge conſpiration of <hi>Catiline,</hi> who with his companions went about to deſtroy his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with fire and ſword: For in that Counſell, <hi>Caeſar</hi> reaſoned ſo gently, as it ſeemed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he made ſmall account of the matter; and in reſpect of his authoritie others after him reaſoned in like manner, ſo mildly and gently, as <hi>Catiline</hi> and his partakers were in a good way to have been abſolved. But when it came to <hi>Cato</hi> his ranke, he reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in another ſort, yea, even plainely to rebuke ſuch as ſpoke before him. <q>Great pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it is (ſayth he) that we are in ſuch a time, when men attribute the name of wicked things to ſuch as are good. Now is it accounted liberalitie to give the goods of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, it is magnanimitie to uſe violence and boldneſſe, it is mercie and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie to plucke criminall and condemned perſons out of a Iuſtices hands: And I pray you, is it ſo ſmall a thing to have conſpired our deſtruction, and the effuſion of our bloud? Another crime might be puniſhed after it ſhould be committed: but

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> who ſhould puniſh <hi>Catiline</hi> after the execution of his conſpiration, and that we ſhal be all dead? They which before have delivered their opinions, ſeeme to be very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of our blouds, and of the bloud of ſo many good men within Rome, to ſpare that of a ſort of wicked conſpirators. If they be not afraid of this conſpiration, ſo much the more (my maſters) have we cauſe to feare, to watch, &amp; hold us upon our guards, without too much truſting them which are in ſuch aſſurance. For our aunceſtors have made themſelves great, by diligence, juſtice, &amp; by good counſell, free from all covetouſneſſe and viciouſneſſe. Vnto them which are vigilant, take paines and uſe good counſell, all things ſucceed well; but ſluggards and cowards had need implore aid of the gods, for no doubt they are both contrarie and angry with them. And

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> therefore my adviſe is, that they which have confeſſed the fault, ſhould die the death of their deſert.</q> 
                        <hi>Cato</hi> in this manner reaſoning againſt the adviſe of others which had been before him, greatly to his commendation, drew the reſt at the laſt to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; yet not more to his honour, than to the diſhonour of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> So then it is not ever evill, that in a Counſell there ſhould be ſometimes <hi>Catoes</hi> and <hi>Appius Caludius</hi> and ſuch like perſons, which often hold ſtrong againſt others: for affaires and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſo much the better cleared and boulted out. It alſo holds other better in order, which otherwiſe by too great facilitie and fear to contradict, ſuffer themſelves to be carried after the firſt opinion, without debate or due conſideration. And truly, in all Counſels there are but too many ſuch as were <hi>Valerius Publicola, Maenenius</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                        <hi>Agrippa, Servilius, Pompeius, Caeſar,</hi> and ſuch like, which alwaies reaſoned gently and mildly in all things: but too few <hi>Catons, Appius Claudius, Quintus Cincinnatus,</hi> and ſuch like, which in Senates hold rigorous opinions. For although for the moſt part ſuch rigorous opinions ought not to be followed, yet they being mingled and diſperſed amongſt others, they<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſerve well to bring to paſſe a good reſolution, and ſo doe make a good and ſweet harmonie in a Counſell or Senat, as <hi>Titus Livius</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21818:25"/>
in many places. And therefore contradictions of opinions, whereof <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi>

This was the cauſe wherefore <hi>Diocleſian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained ſo much of the flatterers of his Court, which keeping cloſe the truth of things, fed him with ſmoke, and ſo by that meanes made him commit many great faults in the adminiſtration of the empire. But becauſe that hyſtorie is worthy the marking, I will recite it at length.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Diocleſian</hi> was borne in a little village, of a baſe and obſcure race <note place="margin">Pompo. Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in Diocl. Vopiſ. in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliano.</note> at Salon in Eſclavonia: yet in his youth, and naturally, he was ſo ambitious and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous of honour, that from a young ſouldier, he aſpired ſtill more higher, that he became a Captaine, and from a Captaine to be a Colonell, and from a Colonell to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be a Lieutenant generall and cheefe of the armie, and finally came to that great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to be the Romane Emperour. When he was come to the ſoveraign degree of all honours, yet was his unſatiable ambition and covetouſneſſe of glorie unſatisfied; for being Emperor, he would needs be worſhipped as a God, and made his feet be kiſſed, on which he ware golden ſhoes covered with pearles and precious ſtones, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the kings of Perſia. But who would have thought that he would have given over the emperiall dignitie, and ſo many honours as were done him? yet in truth he did forſake all this, and deſpoiled himſelfe of his Empire, which he reſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Conſtantius, Chlorus,</hi> and <hi>Galerius,</hi> and retired unto his houſe at Salon in Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> where he lived yet more than ten yeares a privat man, taking his paſtime in gardening and rurall workes, and never repented him whileſt he was a privat man, that he had deſpoiled himſelfe of the Empire. But if this be ſo ſtrange a thing, that a man ſo ambitious, and that ſo well loved the honours of this world, to rid himſelf of ſo great a dignitie, did become (as I may ſay) a Gardiner and a Labourer of the earth; yet more admirable is the cauſe wherfore he did this: For it was for no other cauſe, but for the hatred and evill will that he conceived againſt the flatterers of his Court, which a thouſand waies abuſed him, whereunto he could not well give reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, he was ſo beſieged betwixt their hands. This hath been written by many Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, yea, by <hi>Flavius Vopiſcus,</hi> who placeth flatterers amongſt the principall cauſes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Princes corruptions. And becauſe this place likes me well, I will tranſlate it. <q>A man may aske (ſayth he) What is it that maketh Princes ſo wicked &amp; corrupt? Firſt, their great libertie and abundance of all things they have: Secondly, their wicked friends, their deteſtable attendants, their covetous Eunuchs, their fooliſh and uncivile courtiers, and too plaine ignorance of the affaires of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. I have heard my father tell this, that the Emperour <hi>Diocleſian</hi> returning unto
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21818:26"/>
a private life, was wont to ſay, that there is nothing harder, than to know well how to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> play the Emperour: Foure or five (ſaith he) will aſſemble and make a plot together to deceive the Emperour, after they will ſay all with one voice, what they will have him to doe. The Emperour, who is encloſed in his houſe, cannot know the truth of things as they paſſe, but by neceſſitie is conſtrained to underſtand nothing but what pleaſeth them to tell him, and make him underſtand: ſo doe they cauſe him to give offices to men by themſelves in poſt, which merit them not at all, and makes him caſt out ſuch as beſt deſerve them for the good of the Commonwealth. What ſhuld be ſaid more, to make ſhort, ſaith <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> A good, wiſe, and vertuous Prince is bought and ſold by ſuch people.</q> Behold the very words of <hi>Vopiſcus,</hi> who evidently ſheweth, that <hi>Diocleſian</hi> was diſcontented to be Emperour, becauſe he was governed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> maugre his beard (as they ſay) by flattering Courtiers, which cauſed him to abuſe his eſtate. But I leave you to thinke, if this were not a ſtraunge thing to ſee <hi>Diocleſian</hi> change his emperiall eſtate with a ruſticke life, for the diſpleaſure he tooke at his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Courtiers: for by the contrarie we commonly ſee, that Princes rather pleaſe themſelves marvellouſly to ſee flatterers, and they cannot goe three paces, but they have them at their tailes, and more willingly doe they give their eares unto them than to good people which will tell them the truth of affaires that import their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And he that will tell them this hyſtorie of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> a man need not doubt but they will ſtreight ſay he was a ſot &amp; a beaſt to forſake his dignitie of an Emperor for ſuch a cauſe, and that he better deſerved to be a gardiner than an Emperour. But

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> if they conſider what was the end of <hi>Galba,</hi> of <hi>Commodus,</hi> of <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> and of many other Romane Emperous, which by meanes of flatterers have had fearefull deaths, they will not eſteeme <hi>Diocleſian</hi> ſuch a foole to withdraw himſelfe to a privat habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there to finiſh his dayes otherwiſe than by the hands of murderers. Yet I muſt confeſſe, that he might have done better, to have put away from him all thoſe peſtilent flatterers: and if to rid ſo many at once from the court, there had been great perill in ſo great a change; yet no doubt it was not impoſſible for him to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched them by little and little one after another, and then to have placed good people about him, thereby to have ſtrengthened himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>It is then ſeene by the ſaying of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> that the Maxime of <hi>Machiavell</hi> is a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                        <note place="margin">It is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious thing to hold the truth from the Prince.</note> true precept of flatterie; and that there are no greater flatterers, nor more perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than they that keepe cloſe from Princes the truth of things as they paſſe. And truly, if the Prince have good Counſellors and ſervants, by whom he may be well advertiſed of all truths which may concerne his eſtate, and where he ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and give rules; although ſome lies by flatterers beſowne amongſt them, yet can they not corrupt the good government of the Prince: for truth hath al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> good and wiſe men, which will freely tell him the truth of all that concernes his eſtate, and which are beloved and credited of him.</p>
                     <p>By the Civile laws, he that knoweth any enterpriſe which tendeth to the domage <note place="margin">L. quiſquis. C. ad Leg. Iul. Mai.</note> of his Prince, is bound to reveale it unto him, upon paine himſelfe to be held cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of treaſon. They then which are Counſellors and moſt eſpeciall ſervants of a Prince, which are in a more particular obligation unto their maiſters ſervice than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21818:26"/>
other Subjects are, ought not they to be reputed for traitors when they conceale the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> truth from the Prince, of ſuch things as pertaine to his charge and providence? If any anſwer, that all things for which the prince ſhould provide, import not his ruine, being omitted: I reply, that it may be not his preſent ruine, but yet at length. For one fault and omiſſion draweth an other after it; and that, an other; and ſo by little and little, the eſtate of the Commonwealth; and by conſequent, the Prince fals into confuſion. And yet although the omiſſion of providing, in things where the Prince is bound to provide, doe not import his ruine and deſtruction, either preſent or at length; yet it muſt needs alwaies import damage to the Prince, or his ſubjects. And in everie caſe it is the profit and intereſt of the Prince, to give proviſion and rule therefore. For there cannot come but good, when ſubjects are well governed,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and that there is a good pollicie in all things.</p>
                     <p>Here may be damaunded, Seeing the good Counſellors of a Prince are ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, <note place="margin">Princes love flatterers, &amp; wherefore.</note> and flatterers and evill Counſellors are ſo domigeable, from whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it that yet Princes are well attended on and garniſhed with flatterers, and have few good Counſellors about them? It ſeemeth that Maiſter <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> hath <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Comines, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</note> well hit this marke: Saying that this comes to paſſe, becauſe Princes alwaies ſeeke ſuch as feedes their owne humors and pleaſe them beſt, and contemne ſuch as are contrarie, although they may be more profitable unto them. For (ſaith he) ſuch as have been nouriſhed with a Prince, or which are of his age, or which can beſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſpoſe his pleaſures, or ſuch as apply themſelves unto his will, are alwaies

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in his good grace, and the firſt unto whom he diſparteth and diſperſeth his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and great Eſtates. And a Prince never knowes how to chuſe a wiſe man and of good counſell, untill he find himſelfe in ſome great neceſſitie, and oftentimes hath moſt need of them which before he had deſpiſed: as I have ſeene (ſaith he) of the Countie <hi>de Charoloies</hi> and king <hi>Edward</hi> of England.</p>
                     <p>But upon this point riſeth yet another doubt, Wherefore it is that flatterers doe rather pleaſe Princes, than wiſe men? <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſeemes unto me well to reſolve this queſtion: when he ſaith, That it proceedeth from this, that naturally men, but <note place="margin">Plutar. de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcr. adul. &amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> From hence it followeth, that when a flatterer tels his Prince many goodly things to his praiſe, hee beleeves it, and perſuades himſelfe that there are many praiſe able things in him, although indeed there be nothing. And there helpeth to this <note place="margin">

For if the Prince be <note place="margin">Sainct in Catel.</note> cruell and violent, he will perſuade him that he is Magnanimious and Generous, and ſuch an one as will not put up an injurie or deſpite. If he be prodigall, he will make him beleeve that he is liberall, and magnificall, that he maintaines an eſtate truly Royall, and one that well recompenceth his ſervants. If the Prince be over gone in lubricities and luſts, he will ſay, he is of an humane and manly nature, of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a Ioviall and merrie complection, and of no Saturnine complection or condition. If the Prince be covetous and an eater of his ſubjects, he will ſay, he is worthy to be a great Prince, as he is, becauſe he knowes well how to make himſelfe well obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Briefly, the flatterer adornes his language in ſuch ſort, that he will alwaies praiſe his Princes vice by the reſemblance of ſome vertue nie thereunto. For the moſt part of vices have alwaies ſome likeneſſe with ſome vertue. The flatterer alſo on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21818:27"/>
his part, will not forget to cover his owne faults and vices with the viſage and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of ſome vertue nie unto them. For he will cover his ambition with the zeale of the Commonweale, and will ſay, that for the Princes ſervice, and that the affaires of the Commonwealth might be well governed, he accepted or purſued ſuch an Eſtate, or tooke on him ſuch a charge, which otherwiſe he would never have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded or accepted. His covetouſneſſe he will cover with his Princes honour; and will ſay, that it ſhould be no honour to his Maiſter (who is ſo great a Lord) to have a ſervant poore and contemptible. If he be vindicative, he will alwaies cover his vengeances with the Princes mantle, ſaying that the enmities he hath, is for the good ſervices he hath done to his Prince, and that the Maiſter is deſpiſed and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in the perſon of his ſervant. And ſo of all other vices. Inſomuch that the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Prince who yeeldeth his eares to flatterers, ſhall alwaies ſo be dealt withall, that they ſhall beleeve vices to be vertues. And he will eaſily beleeve this, becauſe (as is ſaid) It is the nature of man too much to love himſelfe, &amp; by conſequent to be blind in judging of himſelfe, beleeving ſtill his vices to be vertues. And contrarie, if the Prince heare a good man ſpeake, which of an evill thing, tels him the evill, and of a good thing, the good; he ſhall never pleaſe him ſo well, as that flatterer. And from hence proceedeth the common proverb, which is as true as can be. <hi>Obſequium amicos, veritatem odium parere:</hi> To follow a mans pleaſure and deſire, gets friends, but the truth, hatred. And this is ſeene, not only in Princes, but alſo in particular and privat men. For ſay to a covetous man, or to a wicked uſurer who eateth up his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Chriſtian brother by exceſſive uſuries, That he is a frugall, good, and wiſe husband, and that he well obſerves S. <hi>Pauls</hi> commandement, who wils every man to have care of his family, and if not care to gather togither goods for his children, he is worſe than an Infidell; certainly you ſhould be accounted his great friend, and he would take great pleaſure to be ſo tickled in his vice. But if you ſay unto him, There is no charitie in him ſo to deſtroy and eat up his brother Chriſtian whom he ought to love as himſelfe, and that true charitie is joined unto faith, pittie, and all other vertues (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) and that he that is without love, is without faith, without vertue, and is a verie Infidell; then have you loſt him for ever, and he will be no more your friend; you have obtained his hatred for telling him the truth.

                     <p>But good people ought not to deſiſt for that cauſe, to ſay the trueth both to <note place="margin">The dutie of a good friend and ſervant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Prince.</note> Princes and to privat perſons. For truly, Truth is ſo goodly and expedient of her ſelfe (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith,) that not onely we ought to preferre her before the good grace favour and amity of men, but alſo before all things of the world. A good man then which loveth Truth, will imitate the example of <hi>Quintius Capitolinus,</hi> who one day making an Oration to the Romane people, after hee had liuely ſhewed them their <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Titus Livius lib</hi> 3.</note> faults, in that they ceaſed not to tumultuate and diſobey their Superiors, whereby ſome great diſorder and confuſion might fall to the common weale, added in the end theſe words: <q>Maſters, I know well, that a man may utter more pleaſant talke, and tell you of things more plauſible; but as for me, my nature is not to flatter, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> neceſſitie cauſeth, that I loue rather to tell you true things, than pleaſant: I have a good mind to pleaſe and content you, but I love much better, to preſerve and guard you from falling into deſtruction, how little thanke ſoever I have of you.</q> Theſe remonſtrances and words of this good man, were of ſuch efficacy by the pure and native truth, which he ſhewed unto the people without any flatterie, that he appeaſed the tumults and diſcontentments of the citie. And as to Princes men ought not to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21818:27"/>
ſpare to ſpeake truth: and that they may not take delight to be praiſed by flatterers,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they muſt ſhew them; that whoſoever praiſeth any man (be he Prince or other) in his preſence, is a flatterer: he muſt ſet before them, the example of that good and wiſe Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who tooke pleaſure in hearing the praiſes of great <note place="margin">Lampri. in Alex. Spart. in Nigro.</note> Princes which had bene before him, but would never heare his owne. And greatly praiſed that ſaying of the valiant Romane captaine <hi>Peſcentius Niger,</hi> who as one day a certaine Orator would needs haue pronounced an Oration called <hi>Panegerica,</hi> in his praiſe, <q>Go thy way (ſaith he) and write the praiſes of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Anniball,</hi> and of other old and valiant Captaines, that we may imitate them: for it is a pure mockerie to praiſe ſuch as do yet live, and eſpecially great Princes, of whom there is hope and feare, and which may bereave a man of both life goods and libertie: as for

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> me, whilſt I am alive, I will do good and approved things; and after my death, then let me be praiſed.</q> The Emperour <hi>Alexander</hi> then alledged this notable ſentence of captaine <hi>Niger,</hi> and would by no meanes be praiſed in his owne preſence. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when men uſed to ſalute him, he would not ſuffer them to uſe titles and ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of flatterie: As, <hi>God conſerve thy Divinitie, thy ſacred Maiestie, thy Clemencie,</hi> (which ſince have been in uſe,) but they muſt ſay onely, <hi>God keepe thee Alexander:</hi> And they which did otherwiſe, or which would uſe too many ceremonies in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, were ſtreight mocked and hiſſed at, yea, forced out of the Emperours chamber. But indeed willingly he would be ſaluted of none but of good men, and of good reputation. Inſomuch, as he cauſed an edict to be publiſhed, whereby hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> inhibited and forbad upon great paines, that none ſhould dare to preſent himſelfe before his face, which knew himſelfe to be, or indeed was of evill fame &amp; reputation. Moreover, they muſt ſhew to Princes, That it is the goodlieſt thing in the world to know himſelfe. For beſides that the knowledge of our ſelves leads us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, it makes that men (although they be great Princes) acknowledge themſelves alwayes men, that is to ſay, ſubject to faile and to do evill, to follow evill, to leave that which is good, to be ignorant of good things, and to know many evill, and to practiſe them. For theſe qualities are common in all men generally. So that he that knowes himſelfe a man, will alſo know and acknowledge himſelfe apt to fall and offend, and ſo will he abate his pride; wheras otherwiſe it would mount and ariſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by the fooliſh and hyperbolicall praiſes of flatterers.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, as it is very requiſite and neceſſarie, that wiſe men which are nigh the Prince, ſhould uſe a free libertie, to tell him the truth of all things which concerne him: ſo muſt they doe it with all modeſtie, accompanied with the honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that God hath commanded us to beare unto Princes, as to his lieutenants. For that Cynicke libertie of ſome Philoſophers, which knew not how to reprehend and ſhew mens faults, but by taunts and bitter biting ſpeeches, are not to be approoved; as did that foole <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who ridiculouſly and triflingly talked with king <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great, as if he had ſpoken to ſome ſimple burgeſſe of Athens. And <hi>Calisthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Plutarke in Alex.</note> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> led with him in his voyage unto Aſia, to inſtruct him in good

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> documents of wiſedome; who indeed was ſo auſtere, hard, and biting in all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances and reaſonings, as neither the king nor any others could take in good part any thing that he taught. It is then very much expedient (if a man mean to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit, and do good by his ſpeech) to uſe gentle and civile talke and perſuaſions, eſpecially if he have to doe with a Prince or great man, which will not be gained by rigor (or as they ſay, by high wraſtling) but by mild and humble perſuaſions. And
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21818:28"/>
above all, men ought well to engrave in princes minds, that notable anſwere which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
                        <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a friend and a flatterer.</note> captaine <hi>Phocion</hi> made unto the king <hi>Antipater,</hi> who had required ſome thing of him which was not reaſonable: <q>I would (Sir) doe for your ſervice all that is poſſible for me, but you cannot have me both for a friend and a flatterer: as if he would ſay, That they be two things farre different, to be a friend and to be a flatterer, as in truth they are.</q> For the true friend and ſervant of the prince, orders and frames all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Plutarke de diſcri. adul &amp; amici.</note> to the good of the prince, and the flatterer tends and bends all his actions to his owne proper good: the true friend loveth with a true love his prince, and the flatterer loveth himſelf: the true friend modeſtly ſheweth his vices in his preſence, and praiſeth his vertues in his abſence; but the flatterer alwaies exalts the prince in his preſence, rather for his vices, than for his vertues, and behind his backe he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and defameth him, vaunting and ſaying, that he governes him at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and that he poſſeſſeth him, and makes him doe what hee will: the true friend perſevereth in the ſervice of his prince, as well in time of adverſitie as proſperitie, and the flatterer turnes his backe in time of adverſitie: the true friend ſerves for an healthfull medicine to his prince, but the flatterer for a ſweet poiſon: the true friend conſerveth his prince in his eſtate and greatneſſe: but the flatteter precipitateth him into ruine and deſtruction, as we ſhall diſcourſe the examples of al theſe things hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, when we ſay that flatterers are pernicious to a prince, that is not ment of all them which dedicate and give themſelves to pleaſe the prince: for there may

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> well be Gentlemen of his owne age about him, to accompany him in his honeſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, as to ride, hunt, hawke, to tourney, to play at tennis, to run, and other like pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, which doe not evill to give themſelves to pleaſe him in ſuch things: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is right neceſſary and requiſit, that the prince have ſometimes ſuch compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. For it ſhould not be good nor comely (in defect, and for want of plaies and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes) hee ſhould to himſelfe procure an habit of a Stoicall humour; neither that he ſhould get a complection too ſevere and melancholicke. Hereof we read a very remarkable example above others in <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, king of Macedon: When he departed from his countrey to paſſe into Aſia, to make war upon that great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator, king <hi>Darius,</hi> he had with him moſt cheefe in his love amongſt others, <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and <hi>Hephaestion,</hi> two gentlemen, his eſpecialleſt friends and ſervants, yet farre <note place="margin">Plutarke in Alex.</note> different the one from the other: for <hi>Craterus</hi> was of an hard and ſharpe wit, ſevere, ſtoicall, and melancholicke, who altogether gave himſelfe unto affaires of Counſell, and indeed was one of the kings cheefe Counſellors: but <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi> was a young gentleman, well complexioned and conditioned in his manners and behavior, of a good and quicke wit, yet free of all care but this, to content and pleaſe the king in his ſports and paſtimes; inſomuch, as men called <hi>Craterus</hi> the kings friend, and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeſtion</hi> the friend of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as one that gave himſelfe to maintaine the perſon of his prince in mirths and paſtimes, which were good to the maintenance of his health. When <hi>Alexander</hi> had conquered Perſia and Media, he begun to apparrell

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> himſelfe after the Perſian &amp; Median manner, the rather to gaine the hearts of thoſe nations newly conquered: <hi>Hephaestion</hi> to pleaſe the king, did the like, leaving the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonike manner, to apparrell himſelfe, as the Perſians and Medes did, for which the king liked him the better: but <hi>Craterus</hi> kept alwaies his old faſhions of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donie, and much blamed that change of faſhions in their apparrell, and ſaid it was but even to barbarize, and begun to taunt and gibe at <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> for it. This their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21818:28"/>
contrarietie of manners, was a cauſe that they entred farre into enmitie and quarrels;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> inſomuch as one day the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y came unto the drawing of ſwords one againſt another, and ſtreight aſſembled their friends on both ſides; wherby had falne out a great mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie, if the king himſelfe had not come in good time, hearing a great noiſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſeperated them, preſently &amp; openly rebuking <hi>Hephaeſtion,</hi> calling him foole and mad man; he tooke alſo privatly aſide <hi>Craterus,</hi> and told him; he greatly marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that he being a wiſe man, would ſo hate <hi>Hephaestion</hi> for ſo ſmall a thing. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he agreed them, &amp; publickely delared unto them, that they were the two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen which moſt he loved in the world, but if any more they fell to quarell again, hee ſwore by <hi>Iupiter Amon,</hi> that with his owne hands he would ſlay him that begun. But after that, they did nothing one againſt other. Hereupon I ſay: That it is neceſſary

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for a Prince to have ſuch as <hi>Craterus,</hi> for his counſell, and it alſo becomes him well to have ſuch as <hi>Hephaestion,</hi> to keepe him companie in his honeſt paſtimes.</p>
                     <p>But to the end men may better diſcerne ſuch as are good friends and ſervants from flatterers, I will now (God willing) diſcover the examples of many ſorts of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, which for the moſt part have had in ſingular obſervation, that Maxime of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> namely: To hold cloſe from the Prince the truth of things: and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſtinguiſh them, I will call them with ſuch names as our aunceſtors have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, which are very proper and covenable unto them. Firſt, there are a ſort of flatterers, which our auncient Frenchmen called janglers, which ſignifieth as much <note place="margin">Ianglers.</note> as a skoffer, a trifler, a man full of words, or (as we call them) long tongues, which by

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their jangling and babelings in rime or in proſe, ſuch as do give themſelves to pleaſe great men, in praiſing and exalting them exceedingly, &amp; rather for their vices, than for their vertues. Theſe be they which by their fair language, can make (as one ſaith) of a Devill an Angell: but in the meane while, they ſo enchant men, and ſwell them up ſo with pride, that in effect they make them become even Angelicall Devils. This ſort of flatterers were baniſhed and driven out of Fraunce in the time of <hi>Philip Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Annal. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the year 1104.</note> as perſons ſerving for nothing but to vanities and corruptions of manners; unto which, Princes and great Lords gave gifts, which might better have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon Gods poore. And therfore that good king made a vow; that he would from thenceforth give to the poore, all that which before he and his anceſtours had

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> given unto janglers. And to the end that other Lords of the court ſhould follow his example, and that they might have no more occaſion to give any thing to the ſaid janglers, he baniſhed them all, as is ſaid, from the court.</p>
                     <p>Such flatterers in truth are very pernicious; for ſeeking too much to exalt and lift up Princes by praiſes, they are cauſes to mount them into pride and unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble fierceneſſe, which after brings their deſtruction. So came it to <hi>Iulius Caeſar.</hi> For <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dion &amp; Plu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tar. in Caeſar. &amp; Sueto. in Caeſ. cap.</hi> 78, 79.</note> 
                        <hi>Lucius Cotta, Coruelius Balbus,</hi> and ſuch like janglers, being nigh &amp; about him, ever perſuaded him, firſt to name the moneth (which then was called Quintilis) with and by his name, <hi>Iulius,</hi> which he did, and ever ſince was it called Iuly. After that, they would needs make him a Temple, to make him be worſhipped as a god, and they

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> called him <hi>Iupiter</hi> in his preſence; they alſo perſuaded him to take the name and crowne of a king, which he was determined to doe, if he had not been prevented by death. When the Senators came to ſpeake with him in his houſe, he would not ariſe to meet them, but thoſe flatterers hindered him; neither would they permit him to riſe out of his chaire to ſalute them, ſaying he was <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the ſoveraign Prince of the Common-wealth, and that all others ought to honor him, and not he them. Theſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21818:29"/>
things which <hi>Caeſar</hi> did againſt his will by the perſuaſions &amp; conſtraint of janglers,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> gathered unto him hatred and evill will of all the Senate, inſomuch, that ſome Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators conſpired againſt him, and ſlew him even in the Senat houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> a certaine time was a good Prince, but the janglers he had about <note place="margin">

Antiq. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.</note> him, by their unmeaſurable praiſes made him become (as ſaith <hi>Suetonius)</hi> a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: they cauſed him to take titles of <hi>Pitions,</hi> The Sonne of Campes or Hoaſts, Moſt good, and Moſt great <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and in the meane while they made him become the moſt cruell, the moſt coward, and the moſt wicked tyrant in the world. He tooke a deſire after all thoſe goodly names and titles, yea to take the name of a King, and to weare a crowne: but his flatterers ſhewed him, that the name of an Emperour was much more than a King: therefore from thence forward he attributed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> a divine honour. So gave he commandement, that men in temples ſhould ſet up images of him through all the world, which were ſubject to the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Inſomuch, that the Governour of Iudea, called <hi>Petronius,</hi> would have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an image of <hi>Caligula</hi> in the great temple of Ieruſalem, but the Iewes would not ſuffer him, which extreamely deteſted images, whereby there had like to have beene a great ſedition: but in all other provinces of the Empire it was executed without contradiction. Yet not contented that his images ſhould bee in all places adored, this deteſtable monſter would many times goe and place himſelfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon betwixt the two images of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> in the Temple which was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to them at Rome, and there made himſelfe to be worſhipped in the middeſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of the ſaid two gods, which hee called his brethren. Moreover, he cauſed a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be builded and conſecrated, where he made his image to be erected, which was of gold, and cauſed it every day to have on ſuch like apparrell as he wore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and founded in that Temple, Prieſts for his ſervice, and to offer up unto him rare and precious Sacrifices, as Pheaſants, Peacockes, and other like birds and beaſts, farre fetched every day. Sometimes went hee into the Capitoll, <hi>Iupiters</hi> Temple, and there would come unto the image of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and make a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to talke with him, and ſpeake in his eare, and then would lay his owne eare to <hi>Iupiters</hi> mouth, as it were to heare his anſwere: ſometimes would hee lift up his voice, and taunt and rebuke <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and after hee was departed from thence,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> then ſaid he that he had ſpoken with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and had obtained that hee asked. I pray you what will you here ſay? Is it poſſible in the world to dreame or imagine a more extreame folly, or a pride and arrogancie more abhominable and enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Behold to what point janglers brought him. But this was not all: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe thus adored, he fell perſuaded, that no man durſt ever enterpriſe any thing againſt him, and ſo committed he a thouſand cruelties, and ſtrange and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wickedneſſes, ſuch as eaſily a ſoveraigne prince might doe, which ſpends his time and power in all exceſſes, wantonneſſe, and riotouſneſſe; wherein he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed to wallow and tumble himſelfe, till he was ſuddainly maſſacred and ſlain: which was a juſt and merited recompence vnto him, becauſe he ſo lightly beleeved

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> flatterers and praiſers.</p>
                     <p>You muſt thinke, that whileſt theſe janglers handled thus their maiſter, leading him to ſuch follies, that they themſelves were merry and joyfull, to ſee him ſo gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after their fancie: yet was there not laughter for them all, and to ſpeak of them which did not laugh, is ſo much the better fit to make others laugh. Firſt then was <note place="margin">Dion in Caio Caligu.</note> one <hi>Macro,</hi> who ſeeking to come in favour and good grace with <hi>Caligula,</hi> not onely
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21818:29"/>
he employed himſelfe to praiſe and exalt the Emperour; but alſo he ſet on his wife,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> called <hi>Ennea,</hi> to make her fit and handſome to gaine the good grace of that young Prince, commaunding her to refuſe him nothing. For ſuch people, to come to the end they purpoſe, care not therein to employ their honour and that of their wives, even ſo far as themſelves, to be very bauds. She then obeying <hi>Macro</hi> her husband, did ſo much by her journeies, that ſhe entred into <hi>Caligula</hi> his amitie, and her ſelfe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto him, how well her husband loved him, and what commaundement hee gave her. Inſomuch, that <hi>Macro,</hi> as well by the meanes of his wife, as by his owne jangling, was a good time in credit. But one day he had done ſomething that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not <hi>Caligula</hi> (as to breake a glaſſe, or ſome other like fault) and this fooliſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour cauſed him to be called. When he came he ſaid: <q>Come hither Gallant, did

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not you commaund ſuch a thing to your wife? doe you not know well, that it is a thing puniſhable by our lawes, to be a baud to his owne wife? You muſt die: and ſo conſtrained him to ſlea himſelfe, without hearing any excuſe or defence.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are yet two others, which received no leſſe, and I will tell you how. The Emperour <hi>Caligula,</hi> being one day ſicke in his bed, theſe janglers came to viſit him. The firſt was one <hi>Afracanus Potitus,</hi> who being nie the Emperours bed, ſeemed to be verie ſad and ſorrowfull for the Emperours diſeaſe, and amongſt other adulatorie talke, he ſaid unto him: I would (Sir) it would pleaſe the gods that I might die for the recoverment of your health; for I make a vow to the gods, that I would die with as good an heart, as ever I did anie thing. The other called <hi>Afracanus Secundus,</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſaid likewiſe to the Emperor: O, would it pleaſed the gods, that I might to utterance go skirmiſh with the Sword plaiers, to be ſlaine of them for your majeſties health: For I ſweare by the gods, that I would willingly employ my ſelfe for your recoverie. <hi>Caligula</hi> anſwered them nothing at that time; but when he was whole, he ſent for them both: and being come, he ſaid unto them. <q>Maiſters, my good friends, I am made to know, that you are verie devout to the gods: For ſince the other day that you came to viſit me, and that you vowed your lives to the gods for my health, I have ſoone recovered it, as you vowed unto me: But fearing a relaps, and againe to fall into my diſeaſe, if you accompliſh not your vow, I have ſent for you to make you die, praying you not to take it in evill part.</q> And withall, without attending their

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> anſwere, he commanded the Captaine of his Guard, to diſpatch them. This foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Emperour, after thoſe janglers had made him become ſuch a beaſt and madde man, did never good thing but this. But in regard of the execution of theſe three flatterers, they encountred the beſt of the world: for they which had made him be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come a foole, merited well to receive part of his folly.</p>
                     <p>But certaine it is, that this ſort of flatterers which are ſo prodigall of praiſes, will not ſpare all honourable titles towards the Princes unto whom they addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whileſt they are in their preſence; but behind their backs, they mocke them, <note place="margin">Dion in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</note> and ſpeake a thouſand evils upon them. <hi>Teridates,</hi> brother of <hi>Vologaeſus</hi> king of the Parthians, in the time of the Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> came to Rome with a great retinue.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> As ſoone as he was arrived, he fell on his knees before <hi>Nero,</hi> his hands together tending towards heaven, ſaid in this manner. Sir, I, which am the Nephew of the great king <hi>Arſaces,</hi> and brother of the king <hi>Vologaeſus</hi> and <hi>Pacorus,</hi> am thy humble ſervant and ſlave, and am come hither to worſhip thee as my god: for I can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what it pleaſeth thee. Thou haſt done well (anſwered the Emperor <hi>Nero)</hi> to come unto me to enioy and have fruition of my ſight, and of my preſence: <q>For
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21818:30"/>
that which thy predeceſſors did not leave thee, I give it thee, and make thee at this

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> preſent, king of Armenia; that thou maiſt know, that it is in me to give kingdomes, and to take them away.</q> After this word, he put a crowne on his head, and inveſted him with the kingdome of Armenia. After (for a paſtime and ſport for this new king) plaies were appointed, wherein <hi>Nero</hi> would needs make it appeare, how well he could play upon the citharon, and indeed plaied amongſt the common plaiers. Alſo he thruſt himſelfe amongſt carters cloathed in greene as they were, to ſhew, that in Liſts he could alſo tell how to handle chariot horſes.

The Empreſſe demanded, what gift he deſired: It is Madame (ſaid he) that it would pleaſe you to put out your feet, that I may pull off your ſhoes.

You muſt then vnderſtand, that in the time of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> many were accuſed for light matters, ſaid or done towards the Emperour; becauſe they knew he tooke pleaſure in ſuch accuſations. Amongſt others, one day there was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vitellio Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. in Top.</hi> 5.</note> in a full Senate, of treaſon, a Romane Knight called <hi>Lucius Ennius,</hi> becauſe he had melted a ſilver image of his owne, which repreſented the Emperours image, to make ſome other worke for his owne vſe; you may thinke what an huge crime

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this was, and how men ſhould find it evill for a man to do with his owne at his owne pleaſure. The Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſeeing that this accuſation had no colour in it, and that it was but a mockerie, to call it a crime, much leſſe a crime of treaſon, he forbad that the Knight ſhould be criminalized for it. Yet <hi>Atteius Capito</hi> a Senator and a great Lawyer, but a very flatterer, roſe up, and as upon a free libertie of ſpeech, he uſed theſe words to the Emperour. <q>Sir, we are here aſſembled in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, where every one hath libertie, freely to vtter his opinion, for the good and uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the common-wealth; we beſeech you, not to take from us the power that we haue, to puniſh ſuch as commit crimes againſt the common-wealth; and pardon not you alone, that injurie, which is done to all. For what a deſpight and contempt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is this, for <hi>Ennius,</hi> that he dare found and caſt into the fire, a Princes image? ought not he, rather to have kept it by him, as an holy and ſacred thing, &amp; to have reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, for the honor of him, whoſe repreſentation it was: this ſhews, what heart and affection he beares towards his Prince, and that if he could, he would do as much vnto him, as he doth to his Image. For he that reverenceth the gods, reverenceth alſo their images. Had he not otherwiſe enough, whereof to make his ſilver veſſel, but to melt for it this ſacred Image? hee would not do ſo much with the images of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius;</hi> for he honoureth them in his heart, and would well at this day find the like, which might enterpriſe the like diſloyaltie againſt our good Prince, as they did againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Our Lawes will, that in crimes of treaſon, the leaſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſuſpition, ſufficeth to condemne the accuſed. And it is the great intereſt and profit for the common-wealth, rigorouſly to puniſh ſuch, as never ſo little attempt againſt the Prince: vnleſſe a man will ſay, that the body hath not to do, neither nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to care when the head is wounded and offended. And therfore I conclude, that juſtice be executed vpon <hi>Ennius,</hi> as a man attainted and culpable of treaſon.</q> The Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> although he was cruell in ſuch matters, knew well, that this faire opinion of the Lawyer <hi>Capito,</hi> was but a meere flatterie, which he vnderſtood better then he vttered: therefore notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>Capito</hi> his remonſtrance and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, he perſiſted in the Inhibitions before made, that the knight <hi>Ennius</hi> ſhould be no more vexed nor endangered about that matter. And the aboveſaid <hi>Tacitus</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſaith, that <hi>Capito</hi> by this his goodly opinion, acquired a great infamy and evill repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to himſelfe, greatly diſhonouring both the knowledge of the civile Law, humane and good letters, wherewith he was excellently endowed. Vpon this point I note that which maſter <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> well ſaith: That Lawyers and great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21818:31"/>
their language, alledging lawes and hiſtories, which every man underſtandeth not,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that often they take euill concluſions. But when they be good men, they may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilouſly order and conduct matters which are handled in Counſell, and bring them to a good reſolution: as may be proved by infinit examples out of <hi>Titus Livius</hi> and other Hyſtoriographers: which I will not here accumulate, becauſe it is from our determined purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>In the ranke of janglers, may well be placed the Poets of our time; which by their Poeſies full of flatteries and lies, ſeeke to hooke in ſome abbotſhip or priorſhip, or <note place="margin">Poets, jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers.</note> ſome other ſuch gift, in recompence of their adulations. I confeſſe, that a Poet may and ſhould take more libertie to write the praiſes of ſome one man, than an Oratour or an Hyſtoriographer: but when praiſes are ſo hyperbolicall, as they rather fall out

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to be the diſhonour than the honour of him of whome they are written, then are they not any thing tollerable. I will take for example but the Epitaphes which were imprinted at Paris a little after the death of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth: There, thoſe goodly Poets ſay, That the king before he died, overthrew more monſters than ever did <hi>Hercules,</hi> in ſhedding ſo much bloud of his rebellious ſubjects: That he died like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who at his death pulled downe and overthrew the pillers which hee had in his armes, and the houſe, upon himſelfe; ſo in Fraunce, juſtice, pietie, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on died with him: That France had been his ſtepmother: That there was in him an exceeding great cunning in all arts and ſciences, and that he was alſo very expert in divers handicrafts: That the king <hi>(Henry</hi> his brother) that now raignes, ſucceeded

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> him as <hi>Castor</hi> to <hi>Pollux,</hi> as one god to another god: That king <hi>Charles</hi> died a martyr of Ieſus Chriſt, and that from thenceforth he ought to be invocated as a Saint. I pray you is there any man of ſober judgement, which doth not plainly ſee, that ſuch ſpeeches become rather men void of wit and underſtanding, by ſome extreame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of flatterie, than theſe gallant Poets, which are drawne on and led with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and right Poeticall ſpirit? for meaning unmeaſurably to praiſe, there eſcapes from them, that they ſpeake things redounding to their diſpraiſe: and if the dead king were alive, he would not thanke them for ſuch praiſes. For a good Prince (as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> ſaith of <hi>Auguſtus)</hi> ever rejecteth ſuch fooliſh praiſes.</p>

                     <p>If thoſe goodly Poets before they had made their Epitaphs, had well read <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> they ſhould have found, that theſe two excellent Poets writ in many <note place="margin">

For that he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a good peace in all the Romane Empire, he cauſed juſtice to flouriſh, hee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21818:31"/>
brought the people into a good repoſe and aſſurance, and reduced againe the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> world. They praiſe him alſo, becauſe he amplified and enlarged the Romane Empire. But they ſpeake not one word of the civile warres: nor for that hee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw <hi>Caſsius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> doe they either praiſe or deſpraiſe him. And indeed (as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> ſayth,) They are pitious triumphs which are made upon civile bloud. Theſe <note place="margin">Plutarch in Caeſar.</note> Epitaphers then ſhould learne to praiſe a Prince, as they ought to doe, and as the elders have done. But when they ſay that our dead king died like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and that with him died alſo pietie and juſtice, which he carried in the deviſe of his two pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; do they not plainely blame the kingdome at this preſent of impietie and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? as if juſtice were not now ſo good, nor religion in ſo good eſtate, as in the time of the dead king; or as if they were or could bee made worſe: yea contrarie, every

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> one ſeeth with his eye, that juſtice and religion are ſtill in as good eſtate in France, as before that the king died, and that they are now ſo well governed, as they cannot waxe worſe. And when they ſay that France was a ſtepmother unto the dead king; is not this injuriouſly to blame the French nation? Wherein hath Fraunce appeared unto him a ſtepmother? Becauſe there were rebels againſt the king, ſay they. They which they call rebels, denie they are ſuch: and in truth when edicts were maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and obſerved, they were ſeene to be very obedient. But let it be ſo, that there were in France ſome rebellious ſubjects; muſt therefore all the nation bee blamed and be called their kings ſtepmother, ſeeing there is no nation in the world more obedient than the French to his Prince? And as for that great cunning in arts, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the meaneſt mechanicall ſciences, which thoſe Poets attribute to our dead king, are not they goodly praiſes thinke you? As if it were ſome goodly vertue in a Prince to make a coffer, or to paint gourdes (for which we reade that the emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> was mocked) or to make ſome ſuch like things. But contrarie, the Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribing <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 6.</note> what kind of Princes the Romane Princes ſhould be, he wils they ſhould have no knowledge in the mechanicall arts: onely they ſhould learne (ſayth he) the Science well to command, to governe, to vanquiſh, to pardon, to make lawes and edicts, and to eſtabliſh good manners and cuſtomes upon the nations under their governance. In like manner, the prophane compariſon of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> where one god ſucceeds another god, how unfit a ſpeech it is for a Chriſtian? If Princes at this day

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> will beleeve janglers, they make themſelves to be adored upon the altar in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt betwixt two Saints, as was <hi>Caligula</hi> betwixt <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi> But ynough is ſpoken of janglers, and of their janglings, and of their too too impudent and ſtrange praiſes.</p>
                     <p>Let us now come unto Marmoſets. A Marmoſet, according to the language of <note place="margin">Marmoſets.</note> our elders, is as much to ſay, as a reporter, murmurer, whiſperer of tales behind ones backe in Princes and great mens eares, againſt one or other, which be falſe, or elſe ought not to be reiterated or reported. And it ſeemes unto me, that this name of Marmoſet is verie proper and fit for ſuch people, and that it meriteth well to bee againe called backe in uſe. And I beleeue it is drawne from hence that ſuch people,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> go marmoting, murmuring and whiſpering ſecretly in Princes eares flattering ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which they dare not ſpeake clearly and on high before the face of him whom they detract and ſpeake evill of. Theſe people are worſe, and farre more perilous than plaine raylers, ſcoffers, jeſters, or janglers, whereof we have before ſpoken: for carrying the countenance of good ſervants and friends, they make the Prince beleeve that they ſerve him as ſpies, to marke and ſeek out the deſignes, evill purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

and carriages of their ſecret enemies, to the end he may not unawares be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of them, and that no evill may come unto him. And becauſe (ſaith <hi>Comines)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Comines, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. 56.</note> Princes are almoſt all ſuſpitious (for doubts and feares that are put into their heads by advertiſements) they eaſily beleeve Marmoſets and reporters. Yea ſome Princes (ſaith he) promiſe them that they will ſay nothing nor diſcover any thing, which is one of the greateſt faults that a Prince can commit. For beſides that, in all men (be they princes or privat perſons) the auncient proverb hath place (which ſaith) <hi>That the ſinewes of Wiſedome is, not to beleeve lightly:</hi> yet is it a thing as particularly required in a Prince, to ſtop his eares to all reports, unleſſe the reporter will be well knowne, and ſuſtaine the puniſhment of a ſlaunder, in caſe his report be not found true. And thereupon the Prince ought to make diligent inquiſition to have the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> truth well averred, when the thing is waightie and meriteth it. And he may not be ſatisfied with a light information thereof: but he ought to heare him which is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or blamed before he beleeve any thing. And if the thing be not of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and import him much, as if they be but words ſpoken (as it often happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) lightly in ſome pleaſant talke, or at the table, or in choler, the Prince ought to deſpiſe and make no account of ſuch words, but as talke uttered in an immoderate bable, and without thinking or conſidering thereof. For there is no man ſo perfect that can ſo bridle his tongue, but there will often fall words without conſideration, which after when he thinkes of them, wiſheth he had never ſpoken them. And this imperfection which is in all men ought to be ſupported of ſome towards others,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and Princes ought rather to beare them then particular perſons, for two reaſons. The one, for that he is more ſubiect to receive reports, than privat men: ſo that if he eaſily deliver his eare unto them, he ſhall ſee a thouſand griefes and diſpleaſures, and ſhall be in continuall doubts and feares. The other reaſon is, becauſe all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to conſider, that men ſpeake more of them than of anie privat perſon. For there is neither great nor little, but he will meddle to ſpeake of Princes, yea to judge of their actions, and everie man to utter his follies of his good or evill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours. What ſhould Princes then doe? It is impoſſible to bridle their tongues, and if they ſhould be forbidden to ſpeake, they would ſpeake the more. Seeing then both great and ſmall doe ordinarily ſpeake of Princes, yea more then of other

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> things, it is impoſſible that in ſuch abundance of talke there ſhould not be alwaies much evill, and he that would ſet foote therein, ſhould binde himſelfe to an infinite paine, from whence he ſhould not know how to get out. For the tongues of men are ſo ready and quicke workers in their trade, that they will frame more buſineſſes in a day, then a thouſand commiſſaries by their enquiries know how to diſpatch in a yeare. Therefore the Prince which contemneth words ſpoken without due delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſuch other things as are not of importance, and which forbiddeth that no man ſhall report unto him ſuch matters, ſhall in ſuch things doe that which is moſt covenable and agreeable unto his gravitie and majeſtie, and in ſo doing, he ſhall ſhew himſelfe more magnanimous, and in heart more generous, neither fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> diſtruſting, or doubting any thing. Such an one was that great <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar:</hi> for one day as one pleaded a criminall cauſe before him againſt <hi>Aemilius Aelianus,</hi> the accuſer amongſt other crimes maintained, that <hi>Aelianus</hi> accuſtomed to ſpeake <note place="margin">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21818:32"/>
would then cauſe him to know, that I have a tongue as well as hee, and would ſay as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> much and more evill of him than hee hath done of me.</q> This poore accuſer ſeeing <hi>Augustus</hi> make no more account of it, was much aſhamed, and wiſhed after, that he <note place="margin">Capitolinus in Marco.</note> had never advaunced ſuch an accuſation. Such was alſo the Emperour <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> with whom, the murmurations which Marmoſets blew in his eares, could not take place, and he made no account of them. As one day, <hi>Lucilla,</hi> the mother of <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> the Philoſopher (which <hi>Pius</hi> had adopted for his ſonne) being in a chappell upon her knees before the image of <hi>Apollo, Valerius Omulus,</hi> who was a Marmoſet, addreſſing his ſpeech to the Emperour <hi>Pius:</hi> Behold (ſayth he) <hi>Lucilla</hi> makes her prayers to <hi>Apollo,</hi> that thou might quickly finiſh thy dayes, that her ſonne might raigne: But the Emperour <hi>Pius</hi> reprooved him for ſuch talke, and told him,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that <hi>Lucilla</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> his ſonne, were too good to think ſuch a thought. So generally we read, That all good emperours, ſuch as the aboveſaid, and <hi>Traian, Adrian, Nerva, Alexander Severus,</hi> and others like, have not onely hated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, but alſo chaſed and baniſhed farre from the court, reporters and relators of falſe tales.</p>

                        <hi>Courtnay</hi> an Engliſh Knight, being one day at the Court of the King of France, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a chalenge unto a French knight, called <hi>Guy de la Tremouille,</hi> by deeds of armes to trie, who was the ſtronger knight and beſt in armes: <hi>la Tremouille</hi> had no deſire to refuſe him: ſo that by the conſent of the King, and of his Vncle the Duke of Burgoigne, and in their preſence, and before many other great Lords, they ranne a launce one againſt the other and no more, for the King would not ſuffer them to go any further: the Engliſh knight was evill content thereat, but yet without making other countenance, deſired leaue of the King to returne into England, which the King graunted, and gave him for his conduction, and guide for his aſſurance unto Calais, the Lord <hi>de Clary</hi> a french gentleman, one renowmed and of great valour.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> As they went by the way, the engliſh gentleman deſired to go by Lucen, to ſalute the Counteſſe of S. Paul the King of Englands ſiſter, who dwelt there, who gently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them and made them good cheere: talking and ſpeaking of newes, as the cuſtome is. This Engliſh told the Counteſſe, that hee could not find in France a knight with whom to do deeds of armes, and that he would never haue thought but to have found in the Court great ſtore, covertly taxing thereby the french Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>Clary</hi> his conductor marked well his words, but he ſpake not one word whileſt he came to Calais: being there, <hi>Clary</hi> angerly ſaid vnto <hi>Courtnay; Meſsira de Courtnay,</hi> I have acquited my ſelfe of the charge which the King my Lord gave mee for your conduction to this towne; now that I haue no more charge of you, I thinke good

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to remember you of certaine words you delivered at Lucen, to Madame the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe of S. Paul, where you ſaid, you could not find in France a knight, with whom to do deeds of armes, thereby taxing the noble knighthood of France: therefore to maintaine with you the contrary, I offer my ſelfe to do deeds of armes with you, in what maner you will chooſe, prouided that you can obtaine of the governour of this towne for the king your maſter, a permiſſion &amp; place to do them. The ſaid permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21818:33"/>
and place was granted, and they ſo fought that <hi>Clary</hi> wounded <hi>M. Courtenay</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> places. This came to the King and his Vncles notice: <hi>Clary</hi> was ſent for, who for his defence ſaid, that that which he had done, was to maintain the honor of France, and alledged many faire reaſons: whereby it ſeemed, that not onely he ought not to have been blamed for that he did in that caſe, but that rather he merited to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and praiſed. The matter was handled in the kings Counſell, &amp; by judgement and decree <hi>Clary</hi> was condemned to priſon for a certaine time, and in the meane while his goods were ſeized into the kings hand, and little there wanted he was not baniſhed France: but a certaine time after, the king pardoned him, at the interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Duke of Bourbon, and of the ſaid Counteſſe of S. <hi>Paule.</hi> And at his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, was made knowne unto him the morive of the kings Counſell, which was

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> this: That the kings Counſell thought him worthy that puniſhment, becauſe a light and raſh ſpeech delivered in familiar talke, he would revenge as a ſerious and weightie matter. If this decree were well obſerved (as it merited to be) we ſhould not ſee ſo many quarrels, murders, and ſuits for our words raſhly and undiſcreetly ſpoken. And it ſhould be a thing much better becomming Chriſtians, not ſo eaſily to feele words preferred and ſpoken upon ſuddaine motion, than in ſo ſcrupulouſly ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>king points of honour, to enter into contentions and quarrels; whereby we make demonſtration, that we are nothing leſſe, than that we would appeare to be. For we would, that by our quarrels and going to law upon an overthwart and raſh ſpeech, men ſhould account us of great heart, that we have our honor in ſingular commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and eſtimation: and in the meane while we diſcover our ſelves in effect to be of a puſillanime, baſe, and feeble heart, that wee cannot deſpiſe and contemne a word of no account, pronounced in haſt. Was that great Emperour <hi>Auguſtus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and many other, ignorant, what were the points of honour? yet were they moſt magnanimous, and had their hearts ſo noble and generous, as they never tooke footing upon any words ſpoken, without good conſideration, but deſpiſed and held them at nothing.</p>
                     <p>The ſentence of the wiſe man is verie true: That ſlaunderers or falſe reporters, <note place="margin">Prov. 18.</note> are like ſecret wounds which go downe into the bowels. For as we ſee that wounds and impoſtumes which ariſe within mans body, are almoſt all mortall, and blowes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with a ſword and other outward wounds, are much more likely to be healed: ſo the words of detraction, of blame, and of ſlaunder that are tolde in the eare, bring often deſtruction, either to the reporter, or to him to whom they are reported, or to him of whom they are ſpoken, either els to all together, as I will ſhew by many approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved examples. But when ſuch words are openly ſpoken in the preſence, or at the leaſt to the certaine knowledge of him whom they touch; there is place to purge and juſtifie himſelfe, and to have recompence by juſtice, or by reconciliation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and mediated by friends; ſo that ſeldome comes any ruine of either one or other.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> was much ruled by <hi>Meſſaline</hi> his wife (which was one

What did ſhe? ſeeing his refuſall; ſhe and <hi>Narciſsus</hi> plotted together ſeperatly, and one after another, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21818:33"/>
tell the Emperour, that they had dreamed ſleeping: That there entred a man into

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Emperours chamber to ſlay him, which was verie like <hi>Sillanus.</hi> And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to tell him this dreame in a morning when they came to ſalute him; at that time alſo they tooke order that <hi>Sillanus</hi> at the ſame houre ſhould enter, to the end the Emperour (who was fearfull) upon his feare he ſhould have of the rehearſall of the dreame, and of the preſent ſight of <hi>Sillanus,</hi> might commaund to ſlay him. This enterpriſe being thus made, <hi>Meſſaline</hi> ſent to <hi>Sillanus</hi> (as from the Emperour) that he ſhould not faile to come unto him the next morning at his ariſing, for a certaine affaire whereof he had to ſpeake with him. The next morning came <hi>Narciſſus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, and knocked at the Emperours chamber doore, and it was opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; beeing entred and counterfaiting a great aſtoniſhment approched the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Emperours bed; and ſeeing him, ſaid: The gods be prayſed, that that is not come to paſſe which I dreamed in my bed (Sir:) how diddeſt thou dreame, ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour? Sir, ſaid he, I dreamed that <hi>Appius Sillanus</hi> had ſlaine you about this houre, and awaking upon it, I ſtraight come to tell you; for ſometimes dreames are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of true things, and are not to bee deſpiſed. The Emperour, who was naturally fearfull, begun to be troubled: the aforeſaid Madame alſo, tooke her courſe to the Emperours bed-ſide, faining alſo a great amaſement, who incontinent told her, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> his dreame; ſhe withall making admirations at it: Oye gods, behold a ſtrange thing! all this night I have done nothing but dreame, that I ſaw a man verie like <hi>Sillanus,</hi> which would needs have entred hither for ſome wicked enterpriſe. The

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> emperour ſeeing the concordance of thoſe dreames, his feare was redoubled, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe <hi>Meſſaline</hi> told him, that that was the onely cauſe of her riſing ſo time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for that this viſion was ever before her eyes, that ſhee could not reſt at her eaſe. Vpon that talke, <hi>Sillanus</hi> came and knocked at the dore: the Vſher which kept the chamber dore, came to tell the Emperor, that <hi>Sillanus</hi> was there, and would ſpeake with him. <hi>Meſſaline</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus</hi> then made a ſhew of feare and great wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and told the Emperour, that it were good to command ſtreight to ſlay him, leaſt he were ſlaine himſelfe. The Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> which trembled for feare, and was exceedingly troubled in his mind, beleeved them, and commanded to ſlay that honeſt gentleman. Behold how by falſe reports, yea, by the report of a dreame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> deviſed, this noble perſon loſt his life. And it is to be marked in this hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that theſe falſe reporters cuſtomably have this ſubtiltie, to trouble a princes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they can either with feare, or anger, or by ſome other meane bring that which they would to their purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> had two ſonnes, <hi>Baſſianus</hi> and <hi>Geta,</hi> which he cauſed to <note place="margin">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which hath ſhewed, that a ſoveraigne principalitie is not incompatible of two in conſort and fellowſhip, as is accounted. <hi>Severus</hi> then being in this purpoſe to leave the government of the Empire to his two ſons together; flatterers about them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it otherwiſe: for they ceaſed not daily to make falſe reports of the one againſt the other, making one underſtand, that his brother had ſuch and ſuch talke of him, and that he aſpired to be alone Emperor after his father, and that it were good
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21818:34"/>
to provide betimes, and that it were better to prevent, than to bee prevented: and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> alike the flatterers of the other, ſaid as much to the other, and more if they could: inſomuch, that thoſe two young princes fell into ſo great and mortall enmitie one againſt the other, that not onely the one hated all the friends and ſervants of the other; but alſo even to death they hated all them which would have agreed them. As ſoone as <hi>Severus</hi> their father was dead, <hi>Laetus,</hi> which was one of the Marmoſets of <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> perſuaded him to ſlay his brother <hi>Geta,</hi> and to feine that he was aſſailed by him. This counſell was found good of <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> who was audacious ynough, and readie with his hand to give the blow: ſo that one morning he entred into <hi>Iulia</hi> the Empreſſe her chamber, mother of <hi>Geta,</hi> whome hee found there, and ſlew him betwixt his mothers armes, who was all bloudie with the bloud of her ſonne. Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently <hi>Baſsianus</hi> got him out, and went to find the ſouldiers of the guard, ſeeming

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to be much troubled and eſcaped. Maiſters (ſaid hee) I have eſcaped faire; my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have ſlaine mee, but I am gotten out of his hands: I pray you let us to the campe, and keepe you me companie, for I am not well aſſured here. The ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which knew nothing of the blow he had given, beleeved it was true, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, much greeved that his brother <hi>Geta</hi> had ſo enterpriſed upon him. Being in the campe, hee gave them all great ſummes of money (for <hi>Severus</hi> had left great treaſure) and made them ſweare they would be faithfull unto him. So that when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they knew the deed done, and found themſelves all gained and corrupted with ſilver, they obeyed him without contradiction, as to one ſole emperour. And what

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> came of all this? <hi>Baſsianus</hi> not ignorant, that the Senate of Rome would find this murder very ſtrange that he had committed of his brother, deſired that great lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Papinian,</hi> who was his kinſman, and had beene as the Chancellor or great maiſter under the Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> that he would goe to the Senate, and make his excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by an Oration well ſet out: That he had done well to ſlay his brother, and that he had reaſon and occaſion to doe it. <hi>Papinian</hi> (who was a good man) anſwered him, That it was not ſo eaſie to excuſe a parricide, as it was to commit it. <hi>Baſsianus</hi> gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at this refuſall, cauſed one of his attendants ſtraight to cut off his head. After this, willing to ſhew to the Senate and to the people, that he greeved becauſe he had ſlaine his brother, and that they might ſee it was done by evill counſell, he cauſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> his Marmoſet <hi>Laetus</hi> his head to be cut off, who had counſelled him to doe that murder: he cauſed alſo to die all them which helped him in that buſineſſe, &amp; which were culpable thereof, ſaying, that they were cauſe thereof. This notwithſtanding to the end <hi>Geta</hi> his friends ſhould enterpriſe nothing againſt him, he made die as many as he could catch of them. So that under that title of being a friend, ſervant, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of <hi>Geta</hi> his brother, he made die many great and noble perſons: yea, he ſlew all ſuch as caried themſelves betwixt them two, as neuter and reconciliators. I pray you what was the cauſe of all this great and horrible butcherie? was it not the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enmitie which theſe Marmoſets had ſowne betwixt the brethren.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> there happened a like thing: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod. lib.</hi> 1.</note> the hyſtorie is memorable, I would rehearſe it a little at length. <hi>Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Emperour was ſurnamed the Philoſopher, becauſe he was a prince, wiſe and ſtudious, and a lover of good letters. In his time there were great plentie of wiſe and learned men, becauſe commonly (ſaith <hi>Herodian)</hi> men doe imitate their prince, and give themſelves to ſuch things as the Prince loveth. There was alwaies about him a great number of good and learned people for his privie Counſell, which hee called
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21818:34"/>
his faithfull friends, as the king of Fraunce alſo at this day dooth call his privie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Counſellors in his pattents. This good emperour being in Hungarie, at the warre with <hi>Commodus</hi> his ſonne, fell into a diſeaſe, whereof he died. But before his death hee cauſed his Counſell to aſſemble, and to recommend his ſonne unto them, &amp; made a little remonſtrance, worthy of ſuch a Prince, in this manner. <q>I doubt not (my good friends) that you are not anguiſhed and ſorrowfull, to ſee me of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For humanitie cauſeth, that eaſily wee have compaſſion of mens adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but eſpecially when we ſee them with our eyes. But yet in my regard, there is a more ſpeciall reaſon: for I doubt not but you beare mee alike good will, to that which I have ever borne you. But now is the time for me to thanke you, that you have alwayes been unto me good and faithfull Friends and Counſellors. And I

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pray you alſo not to forget the honour and amitie which I have borne you. You ſee, my ſon, which you your ſelves have nouriſhed, who now entreth into the flower of his youth: who as he that entreth into an high ſea, had need of good Patrones and Governours, leaſt by ignorance and evill conduction, hee ſtray from the right way, and ſo come into perill. I pray you then, my friends, whereas he had no more fathers but one in me; be you many fathers unto him, that he may be alwaies made better by your good counſels. For truly, neither the force of ſilver and treaſures, nor the multitude of guarders can maintaine a prince, and make him be obeyed, unleſſe the ſubjects which owe obedience, doe beare him good affection and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. And aſſuredly they onely raigne long and aſſuredly, which ingrave and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> inſtill in their ſubjects hearts, not a feare by crueltie, but a love, by bountie. For they ought not to bee any thing ſuſpected to a prince, in that they doe or ſuffer which are drawne to obedience by their owne will, and not by conſtrained ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And ſubjects will never refuſe obedience, unleſſe they bee handled by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and contumelie. Very true it is, That it cannot bee but hard for a ſoveraigne prince, who is at his full libertie, moderately to guide and bridle his affections. But if you alwayes admoniſh him to doe well, and to remember the words which hee heareth now of me, that am his father, I hope you ſhall find him a good prince towards you and all others. And in thus doing, you ſhall manifeſtly ſhew, That you alwayes have mee in remembrance, by which onely meanes you may make

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mee immortall.</q> Vpon this ſpeech, his heart and his word failed with languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then all his Counſellors which were there, begun to weepe &amp; lament, yea ſome could not containe from crying, for great ſadneſſe and bitterneſſe of heart that they had, to ſee ſo good a prince faile. After his death <hi>Commodus</hi> his ſonne and ſucceſſor in the empire, governed himſelfe ſome little time by the good people and auncient Counſellors of his father: but this continued not long: for there were ſtraight, Marmoſets, which found ſubtill meanes and entries to get into him, which when they ſaw their time, begun to ſay unto him: What meane you to tarie in this baſe and barraine countrey of Hungarie, better it were for you to bee at Rome, to have all the pleaſures in the world: you have no cauſe to beleeve theſe tutors which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> your father left you; you are no child, to bee governed by tutors. <hi>Commodus,</hi> who was a faire young prince, and one that deſired nothing but his pleaſures, and who yet had no great reſolution (although his father had taken great paines to inſtruct him wel) begun to let himſelf to be led with Marmoſets, which never ſpoke anything unto him but of merry and pleaſant things. So made he a ſhamefull and diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable peace with the Barbarians, againſt whom his father had commenced warre,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21818:35"/>
and retired to Rome: being there, he begun to become cruell, eſpecially againſt the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> good and auncient counſellors of his fathers, which hee cauſed almoſt all to die, at the inſtigation of his Marmoſets, which reported unto him; that they bore him no good will; that they blamed his actions, and controuled his pleaſures: He cauſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many Senatours to die, which his reporters for the ſame reaſon diſgraced. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Marmoſets, he had one called <hi>Perennis,</hi> which perſuaded him to care for nothing, to take his pleaſures, and to let him alone with the charge of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. <hi>Commodus</hi> was glad thereof; and to plunge him into all lubricitie and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe; <hi>Perennis</hi> provided for him three hundred concubines and harlots, and as many ſlaves. Having caſt him into this gulfe and deſtruction, hee tooke upon him the affaires of the empire, and begun to make ſtay, and confiſcate the goods of all ſuch as he bore no good will unto, and unto ſuch as contradicted his doings, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſold juſtice for money. So in a little time made he himſelfe very rich; but this endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not long: For in a warre which the Romanes had againſt the Engliſhmen, hee caſhiered the Senatorian captaines to bring into their places ſimple knights, which all the Romane armie much diſdained; inſomuch, that they cut <hi>Perennis</hi> in peeces, as an enemie of the commonwealth. <hi>Cleander</hi> was another Marmoſet, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his place, who at the beginning made ſome ſhew, that hee would doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but incontinent he did worſe: for practiſing many cruelties; he ſold the eſtates and governments of provinces to them which would offer moſt. There happened at Rome a great famine and a peſtilence withall. The people (which alwaies lay the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> cauſe of publicke calamitie upon the Governors) bruted abroad, that <hi>Cleander</hi> was the cauſe of this plague and famine, and that therefore there was cauſe hee ſhould die. <hi>Cleander</hi> to ſtop this brute and fame, &amp; to cauſe the people to hold their peace, cauſed all the emperours horſemen to be armed, and in both the ſuburbes &amp; towne to ruſh through the people, ſlaying and wounding innumerable. But the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to take houſes and fight from the windowes ſo well, that the ſaid horſemen were conſtrained to retire. <hi>Fadilla,</hi> (the Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> his ſiſter, ſeeing this civile warre commenſed and raiſed by <hi>Cleander</hi> within the town) went to find her brother, whom ſhee found in the brothelhouſe amongſt his harlots, where he tooke his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes: and all bewept, ſhe fell on her knees before him, ſaying: <q>Sir, my brother,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> you are here taking your pleaſures, and know not the things that paſſe, nor the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherein you are: for both yours and our blood is in perill, to bee altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the warre and civile ſtirre which <hi>Cleander</hi> hath raiſed in the towne: He hath armed your forces, and hath made them ruſh againſt the people, and hath brought them unto a ſlaughter more than barbarous, filling the ſtreets with Roman blood. If you doe not ſoone put to death the author of this evill, the people will fall upon you and us, and rive us in peeces.</q> Saying theſe words, ſhe tore her garments, and was very ſad, yea, as it were deſperate: many alſo which were preſent, encreaſed the feare of <hi>Commodus</hi> by their perſuaſions, inſomuch, that he fearing greatly ſome great danger to himſelfe, ſent in haſt for <hi>Cleander,</hi> who knew nothing of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> As ſoone as he was arrived, he cauſed his head to be cut off, which he cauſed to be carried on a pikes point through the towne, in ſuch ſort, that the ſight of that head did appeaſe the ſtirre of the people. After this execution, <hi>Commodus</hi> (who had acquired infinit enemies by the meanes of his Marmoſets) determined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at once to cauſe a goodly execution to be made, becauſe hee would not often returne thereunto (which is one of <hi>Machiavels</hi> precepts, whereof wee ſhall ſpeake
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21818:35"/>
in his place) and for that purpoſe made two rowles of the names of ſuch as he would

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cauſe to die, one of which was entituled <hi>La dagne,</hi> the dagger: and the other <hi>L'eſpee,</hi> the ſword. Theſe two rowles by hap fell into the hands of <hi>Laetus</hi> who was one of his Marmoſets, and of <hi>Martia,</hi> one of his courtizans, which found themſelves firſt in a rowle. They then ſeeing the danger nigh and evident wherin they both were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred together, &amp; reſolved rather to ſlay than be ſlaine. <hi>Martia</hi> tooke the charge to poyſon him, which ſhe did; but <hi>Commodus,</hi> who had eaten &amp; drunken too much, was provoked to vomit, and with all that caſt up his poyſon: which <hi>Laetus</hi> and <hi>Martia</hi> ſeeing, cauſed him to be ſtrangled in his bed. Behold here the end wherunto <hi>Peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, Cleander,</hi> and other Marmoſets brought their maſters, and the end they made themſelves, and the great evils, and ſlaughters of good people, whereof they were

Thinke you not that this is a goodly example to all kings &amp; princes, to keepe them from ſuffering themſelves to be governed by reporters and flatterers? The emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> was one of the moſt noble and illuſtrious raſe in the world, a goodly and perſonable prince as was poſſible, who was neither ſubtill nor malicious of his nature, the ſonne of the beſt prince that ever was, who brought him well up, and left him a great number of wiſe and prudent men, well to govern him, and towards him had gotten the favour and good will of all the world.

                     <p>The emperour <hi>Severus</hi> had on his Counſell, one <hi>Vetronius Turinus,</hi> whome hee <note place="margin">Lampri. in Alex.</note>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> judged to be a good man, but he prooved to be a very Marmoſet: for before the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour he diſſembled well, and knew well how to carrie hie countenaunce and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but behind his backe he vaunted, that he governed <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> at his pleaſure; &amp; that he cauſed in the Counſell-chamber, ſuch reſolutions as he thought good of.

For at this time, the king having not perfect ſences, his affairs were handled with the princes of the blood, and the privie Counſell: but contrarie, the duke of Burgoigne his Marmoſets, ſaid, That he was the chiefe peere of France, and as they cal it <hi>le Doy en des Pairs;</hi> that he was more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and more rich than the duke of Orleans; and although he was not ſo neere of the blood Roiall as he, yet was he more neere by alliance; (for the Dauphin, who was yet very young, had eſpouſed his daughter) and therefore he ought in nothing to give

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> place unto the duke of Orleans, but that hee ought to maintaine and hold the ſame ranke, that <hi>Philip</hi> duke of Burgoigne (his deceaſſed father) did, who whileſt his father liued, governed the king and the kingdome at his wil. Briefly, theſe tatlers and repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cauſed this duke of Burgoigne ſo to mount into ambition and covetouſneſſe to raigne, that he enterpriſed to cauſe the duke of Orleans to bee ſlaine, who hindered his deſeignes and purpoſes: and indeed he cauſed him to be moſt villanouſly maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ſlaine at Paris, nie the gate Barbette, by a ſort of murthering theeves which he had hired, as the duke of Orleans went to ſee the queene (who had lately bene brought to reſt of a child.) Great domage there was for that good prince, for he was valiant and wiſe as poſſible one might be. Of him deſcended king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> now raigning, both by father and mother.

But the Marmoſets of duke <hi>Iohn</hi> of Burgoigne, were they which ſtroke the yron againſt the flint, out of which came that ſparke of fire (a device fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken by the duke of Burgoigne) which brought into combuſtion and into a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

The duke and his brother much greeved hereat, found meanes to take him priſoner,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and put him in a ſtrong caſtle, whereunto he would never goe, to heare, or ſee him, he ſo much diſdained him. But yet he ſent men unto him, which hee truſted, which indeed proved very Marmoſets and falſe reporters: for after <hi>Giles</hi> of Bretaigne had remained within the caſtle a certaine time, and that he had conſidered well his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that he was borne the kings vaſſale of France, and that he ought never to have diſunited himſelfe from his brother; he then praied his brothers people, that came to ſee him, to tell him from him, that he greatly repented what hee had done, and that if it pleaſed him to pardon him, that from thence forward he would follow with a good heart the part of the king of France and his; and that if it pleaſed them, hee would ſtreight ſend to the king of England his Order, and Conſtables ſword. What

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> do his Marmoſets then? They report to the duke, that <hi>Giles</hi> his brother was ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and ſo perfect Engliſh, that no reaſons they could make, could turne him unto that ſide. The duke ſent ſtill many times the ſame men unto him, but alwaies they made the like or worſe report of him: inſomuch, that this good duke, fearing that his brother was invincible in his obſtination, fearing alſo, that if hee ſhould let him looſe, he would cauſe the Engliſh to come into Bretaigne to avenge himſelfe, commanded the ſame reporters to ſtrangle him in priſon: which they did. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (as God when he ſeeth his time, brings the moſt hid things to light) theſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering reporters could not hold, but diſcover the truth of the matter, and that <hi>Giles</hi> of Bretaigne would have done any thing that the duke his brother would have had

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him to doe: which comming to the dukes eares, he was nigh out of his wits for his brothers death, and cauſed the reporters to be hanged, and to die with great and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous paines and executions. Behold the end of <hi>Giles</hi> of Bretaign, and the reward which ſuch Marmoſets received, which were cauſe of his death. Hereof Princes may note a rule; Not to beleeve too eaſily reports made of men, without hearing them, but eſpecially when it toucheth life.</p>
                     <p>One day before the emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> there was one <hi>Alexander,</hi> which accuſed <note place="margin">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were but paper and inke, and it might be made at pleaſure: but in criminall cauſes we muſt not beleeve witneſſes in writing, but witneſſes themſelves, in hearing, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating, and confronting them with him that is accuſed.

                     <p>I would now rehearſe an example truly tragicall, of king <hi>Richard</hi> of England, who was ſonne of that valiant and victorious prince of Wales. This king came to the crowne very yong, and had three good uncles about him, the duke of Lancaſter,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21818:37"/>
Yorke, and Gloceſter, by whoſe counſell for a certaine time hee governed well his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> kingdome. But the earle of Suffolke (whom the king made duke of Ireland) entred ſo farre into the kings favour, that he governed himſelfe after his fancie. Then took he occaſions to talke ſo of the kings uncles, as was very ſtrange: for he told him, that his uncles deſired nothing, but to deale in the affaires of the kingdome, to obtaine it to themſelves, a thing which they never thought. And did ſo much by his reports, that the king put his uncles from his counſell, and from dealing with any of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the kingdome: whereof the people, and eſpecially the Londoners were ſo evill contented, that they roſe up and made warre againſt the king, or rather againſt the duke of Ireland, and they were at a point to give the battell one againſt the other. But the duke of Ireland, who was generall of the kings armie, loſt his courage with

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> great feare, that he had to be ſlain or taken, and therfore fled &amp; paſſed into Flanders, where he finiſhed his dayes, never after returning into England. As ſoone as he was fled, his armie was diſſipated, &amp; the kings uncles ſeized upon the kings perſon, &amp; eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a new Counſell, &amp; by juſtice executed ſome of them which were of the duke of Ireland his adherents. A longtime after, another Marmoſet, called the earle Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, gained the duke of Ireland his place, and was ſo farre in the kings good grace, that he governed all as he would. One day (this earle Marſhall talking with the earle of Darbie, eldeſt ſonne of the duke of Lancaſter) the earle of Darbie chanced to ſay: Couſin, what will the king do? will he altogether ſubject the Engliſh nobilitie? there will ſoone be none: it is plainely ſeene, that he deſireth not the augmentation of his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> kingdome. But he held this talke, becauſe the king had put to death &amp; chaſed away a great number of gentlemen, and cauſed the duke of Gloceſter to die (a prince of his blood) and yet continued in that rigour, to make himſelfe be feared, and reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſtill, that which was done in the duke of Irelands time. The earle Marſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing to the ſpeeches of the earle of Darbie, but only marked them in his heart. Certain daies after, he reported them to the king, and to make them ſeeme of more credit, he profered, and ſaid hee was readie to enter into the campe againſt the earle of Darbie, to averre the ſaid words, as outragious &amp; injurious againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie. The king not meaſuring the conſequence of the deed, in place to make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe words, ſent for the earle of Darbie, his couſin germane, and after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> before him the earle Marſhall ſpeak his wil was, they ſhould enter into the camp, and fight it to utterance. But the kings Counſell conceiving it might come to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evill example, ſuch great lords to ſlay one another, and that the earle Marſhall was not of equall qualitie unto the earle of Darbie, they counſelled the king to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, namely, to baniſh from England for ever the earle Marſhall, becauſe he had raſhly appealed and challenged unto ſingle combat a Prince of the bloud, &amp; to baniſh alſo the Earle of Darbie for ten years only, for ſpeaking the aforeſaid words of the king his lord. The king following the advice of his Counſel, &amp; by ſentence given by himſelf, baniſhed the earle Marſhall out of England forever, &amp; the earle of Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie for ſix years only, moderating his Counſels advice foure years. When the earle

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of Darbie came to depart, there aſſembled in the ſtreets before his gates at London, more than fortie thouſand, which wept, cried, &amp; lamented his departure, &amp; extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blamed the king and his Counſell: inſomuch, that going away, he left in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts an extreame anguiſh and greefe for his abſence, and a very great amitie towards him: yet notwithſtanding he left England, and came into France. Whileſt he was in France, the duke of Lancaſter, his father, died. The king to heape up his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21818:37"/>
evill lucks, cauſed to be taken &amp; ſeized into his hands all his lands &amp; goods, becauſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they fell to the earle of Darbie. Hereby hee got great hatred and evill will of the Nobilitie, and of all the people. Finally, the Londoners (which are a people eaſie to ariſe) made a complot and part againſt the king, and ſecretly ſent word to the earle of Darbie, that hee ſhould come, and they would make him king. The earle arriving in England, found an armie of the Londoners ready. So went he to beſiege the king <hi>Richard</hi> in his caſtle unprovided, whom he tooke and impriſoned, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to reſigne unto him the Realme and Crowne of England. King <hi>Richard</hi> was put to death in priſon, after hee had raigned two and twentie yeares: a thing very ſtrange, rigorous, and unheard of in England or in any kingdomes nigh unto it. And ſo the earle of Darbie, who had beene baniſhed from England, remained a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> peaceable king, and was called <hi>Harry</hi> the fourth of that name. This earle Marſhall, who kept at Veniſe, knowing theſe newes, died ragingly. This was the end of this Marmoſet, and the tragicall evill hap whereunto he brought his maſter, and that upon words reported, which were never ſpoken, as any evill ſpeech of the king: but onely for the greefe hee had, that they of his Counſell governed ſo evill the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes affaires.

But as one ſinne draweth after it another, <hi>Salome</hi> fearing that thoſe two aforeſaid children would feele afterward,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their defence, they began to weepe and lament. <hi>Caeſar</hi> knew well thereby that the poore children were full of innocencie. So he exhorted them from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to carry themſelues in ſuch ſort towards their father, that not only they ſhould not doe againſt him any thing vnworthy or greevous, but alſo ſhould doe ſo much as to bring themſelves farre from all ſuſpition. He exhorted alſo <hi>Herodes,</hi> to uſe his ſonnes well, and to keepe them in his favor. Then fell the children on their

knees before their father with great effuſion of teares, crying him mercy, by which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> meanes they were reconciled unto their father. But after the returne of <hi>Herodes</hi> and his children, this furie <hi>Salome</hi> (not contented with this reconciliation which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had made) began to lay new ambuſhes by falſe reports that ſhe made to <hi>Herodes,</hi> wherein ſhe mixed ſome truth, to give the better taſte: <hi>Herodes</hi> who was very credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in ſuch matters, made <hi>Auguſtus</hi> underſtand, that his children had againe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired his death. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> anſwered him, That if his children had done againſt him the thing which merited puniſhment, that he ſhould chaſtice them as he thought good, and that he himſelfe gave him power and permiſſion ſo to do. The aboveſaid <hi>Herodes</hi> joyful to have received this power, being led with an irreconcileable rage, by the meanes of <hi>Salome,</hi> cauſed the two poore children <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> to

Five daies after, <hi>Herodes</hi> died like a mad man, for the evill haps he had in his children, and this rage lighted a fire in his entrailes, which rotted him by little and little, wherupon engendred worms, which eat him alive, with horrible languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before his death.

To ſhun the miſcheefe that may come therupon, there is nothing better than to follow the precept of <hi>Comines,</hi> namely; That the king have many Counſellors, and that hee <note place="margin">

For if hee commit much more to one than to another, he wil be maſter, and the others dare not reaſon againſt him freely, or els knowing his inclination, dare not contradict him. Therefore in a criminall cauſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> handled before the Senate of Rome againſt a gentlewoman of a great houſe, called <hi>Lepida,</hi> accuſed of treaſon; the emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> (although he were very rude in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cornel. Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, annal. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; li.</hi> 5.</note> ſuch caſes) would not ſuffer his adoptive ſonne <hi>Druſus</hi> to reaſon firſt, leaſt (ſayth <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus)</hi> thereby had been laied and impoſed a neceſſitie for others to have conſented unto his opinion. And in another cauſe of like matter, where <hi>Granius Marcellus</hi> was accuſed in a certaine place to have ſet his owne image above the emperors. When
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21818:38"/>
the cauſe came to handling; <hi>Piſo</hi> (whoſe opinion the Emperour deſired firſt) began

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thus to ſay: <q>And you (Sir) in what place will you reaſon? for if you reaſon laſt, I feare that by imprudencie I ſhall not diſſent from you.</q> For that cauſe <hi>Tiberius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he would not reaſon at all: &amp; indeed the accuſer was abſolved, although the Emperour had ſhewed a countenance to be angry againſt him, as he heard the accuſation rehearſed. And there is no doubt, but that the counſell of one alone is <note place="margin">Counſell of one alone dangerous.</note> perillous to the prince, becauſe naturally men are divers waies paſſionate, and that which ſhall be governed by one alone, is often by paſſion guided. Alſo the indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mens perſons cauſeth, that every one hath not alwaies his head well made, (as they ſay) nor are wiſe at all ſeaſons; and mens ſpirits, as well as their bodies are journals, and have their viſcicitudes and changes: for from the wiſeſt ſometimes doe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eſcape abſurd and ſtrange opinions. An example hereof may well be <hi>Charles,</hi> duke of Burgoigne then earle of Charolois: hee having made a peace with the towne <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Com. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 27 <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.</note> of Liege, went ſoone after to beſiege Dinant, a towne nigh the other. They of Liege going againſt the treatie of peace, made readie an armie to go ſuccour Dinant, but they there arrived after the towne was taken. The duke fierce of his victorie, would needs have ruſhed upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Liege as peace breakers, but an agreement was made; That they ſhould obſerve the ſaid forme of peace, &amp; that for effect that they ſhould give three hundred men for hoſtages (which were named) the next morning at eight of the clocke. The next morning came, and eight of the clocke, yea noone, but no hoſtages were delivered; ſo that the duke would gladly have run upon the towne of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Liege: yet he demanded counſell of the knights of his Counſell. The marſhall of Burgundie, and the lord de Countay were of advice to fall upon them, &amp; that there was juſt occaſion, becauſe they had not held their word to ſend hoſtages at the houre they promiſed; and a man might now have them in good caſe, becauſe they were all devided and diſperſed. But the earle of S. <hi>Paule</hi> was of a contrary mind, ſaying; That a multitude could not bee ſo ſoone accorded, and that men muſt not ſo mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure affaires of importance, by houres and minutes, but that it were yet good to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them by an harrold. This opinion of the earle of S. <hi>Paule</hi> was followed of the moſt of the Counſell: ſo that a Trumpet was ſent to ſummon them, who met the hoſtages by the way comming to the duke. Here note; if the duke had had of his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Counſell none but the ſaid Marſhall, and de Countay, what effuſion of humane blood had followed of theſe poor Liegiois, which would well have kept their words, but they could not ſo ſoone effect it? What yet came to paſſe? Yet certaine time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſaid men of Liege broke againe the ſaid covenants of peace: ſo that the ſaid duke would have cauſed to die the ſaid three hundred hoſtages, which could not do withall, nor were the cauſe of the peace breaking, but they were onely pledges and anſweres of the publicke ſaith. The duke asked his Counſels advice. The ſaid de Countay was of advice; they ſhould be ſlaine: but <hi>M. de Imbercourt,</hi> a wiſe knight, was of the contrary mind, ſaying: It were beſt to take God on our ſide, and not to ſley ſo many innocents for the fault of their concitizens: and for their yeelding

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> themſelves hoſtages was in part to obey their common-wealth, and partly to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves for the good of their countries, but that for that cauſe they merited not to die. This opinion was followed, and that de Countay rejected as cruell. A lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle while after died the ſaid de Countay, as if it were by a judgement of God: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that no man had ever ſeene him before, either cruell in deed or in opinion.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> emperour <hi>Otho (Galba</hi> his ſucceſſour) was evill beloved of all the people, which <note place="margin">Dion. in Othon.</note> were in an exceeding feare to ſee about him, them which had beene the miniſters and Counſellors to <hi>Nero.</hi> For although <hi>Otho</hi> after hee was created Emperour, made a reaſonable good entrie, and ſhewed himſelfe very kind, and courteous, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all things, ſeeking by liberalitie and ſuch other meanes to obtain every mans good will: yet men could not truſt him in any manner, nor hope from him any good as long as he was ſerved with <hi>Nero</hi> his ſervants.

                     <p>Contrarily, king <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth comming to the crowne of France, governed himſelfe evil, by leaving and forſaking the old and ancient Counſellors and ſervants of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh, his father, ſuch as the Countie <hi>de Dunois,</hi> the Marſhall

For he ought to have conſidered, that he ſucceeded a king which was wiſe, and who had very well managed and ruled his realme, and by conſequent, who had good Counſellors and ſervants, which the rather he ſhould have reſerved and retained in his ſervice, as indeed hee did a good time after he was made king, when he knew by experience the fault he had made. For amongſt other good parts which were in the ſaid <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, he was not proud, but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and could well acknowledge his faults, and amend them: inſomuch, that the fault that he made in diſappointing the good ſervants of his father, ought no more

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to be imputed unto him for an error, ſince he corrected and amended it. As ſayth the Poet <hi>Sophocles:</hi>

have been procured rather upon envie, than upon juſt complaint, they have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> made againſt them which governed: and ſuch envies do often proceed, when kings governe themſelves by men of baſe hand, as they call them: for then are princes and great lords jealous. And therefore (to ſhun ſuch jealouſies and juſt complaints that great men may have to ſee themſelves deſpiſed, (a prince ought ſo to advance meane men, that hee recoile not great men: and meane men ought alwaies to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the place from whence they came, reſpecting great men according to their degrees, without ſtaggering in their dutie to their prince &amp; common-wealth. And when they ſee, that by ſome accident they are evill beloved of great men, or of the common people, and that for the good of peace it is requiſit to extinguiſh the envie and jealouſie conceived againſt them, they ought voluntarily to forſake their

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eſtate. For willingly to retaine it to the detriment and confuſion of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, therein doe they evidently ſhew, that they are not good ſervants of their prince. King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh had Counſellors both wiſe and loiall, as <hi>M. Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guy du Chastell, M. Iohn Lowet</hi> preſident <hi>de Provence,</hi> the Biſhop of Cleremont, <note place="margin">Annal. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>An.</hi> 1426.</note> and certaine others of meane qualitie, which had done him great ſervices in great affaires he had had, as well when he was Dolphin, as after he was king. At that time this king had civile warre againſt the duke of Burgoigne, whome ſecretly the duke of Bretaigne favoured: which warre the king would gladly have had extinguiſhed. Therefore hee himſelfe openly ſpoke to the ſaid lords and dukes, which made him anſwere: That they were content to come to ſome good accord, provided, that hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> would put from him ſuch Counſellors as he had, and take others. Theſe beforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Counſellors knowing this, ſaid to the king. Since (Sir) it holds but thereon to quench civile warre which there is againſt the houſe of Burgoigne, let them all goe home againe, it ſhall not come of us, that ſo good a thing ſhall bee hindered: and they themſelves deſired and counſelled the king to accord to that condition. Theſe were good and loyall Counſellors, but they are dead, and there are no more ſuch to bee found. But ſuch there are now adaies, which had rather ſee the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in combuſtion and ruine, than they would ſuffer themſelves to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their places one pace. Yet theſe good Counſellors aboveſaid withdrew to their houſes willingly and without conſtraint; and ſoone after peace was accorded

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and finiſhed betwixt the king and the duke of Burgoigne. Theſe good perſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged not: That men ſought to take away the kings faithfull Counſellors, to ſeduce and deceive him, and that their dutie commaunded them then more than ever to keepe nigh his Majeſtie, ſeeing the great troubles and affairs of the kingdome, and that otherwiſe they might be accounted traitors, and diſloiall: No, no, they alledged no ſuch thing; they looked right upon the white, to keepe peace in the kingdome. For they knew well, that if they had uſed theſe reaſons to the duke of Burgoigne, that he could ſoone have anſwered &amp; replied, that they were too preſumptuous and proud, to thinke that in all the kingdome of Fraunce there could not be found peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as wiſe and faithfull to their prince, as they. For in all times the kingdome of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Fraunce more than any other hath ever beene well furniſhed with wiſe and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people of the Nobilitie, Iuſtice, Cleargie, yea, Marchants, and of the third Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>To come againe to our purpoſe, certaine it is, That a prince which committeth the government of his affaires to one alone, brings himſelfe in great daunger, and hardly can ſuch governement bee without great miſcheefes and diſorders. For this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21818:40"/>
commonly men hold, That being lifted up unto great honor and dignitie, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> hold a moderation and mediocritie, which is that which giveth taſte and grace to all our actions. The emperour <hi>Severus</hi> ſo high advaunced <hi>Plautianus,</hi> that being great maſter of his houſhold, the people thought (ſeeing his dealings in his office) that hee was the emperour himſelfe, and that <hi>Severus</hi> was but his great maſter. Hee <note place="margin">Dion &amp; Spartian Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vero.</note> ſlew, robbed, baniſhed, confiſcated the goods of all ſuch as hee would, in the ſight and knowledge of <hi>Severus,</hi> who contradicted him in nothing. So farre mounted this great and immoderate licenſe; that <hi>Plautianus</hi> durſt well attempt to cauſe <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to be ſlaine, and his two ſonnes. But his wickedneſſe was diſcloſed by a captaine, unto whom he had diſcovered it: inſomuch, that <hi>Severus</hi> cauſed him to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and although by nature he were a cruell Prince, yet was he ſo firmely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Plautianus,</hi> that he never ſpoke ſharpe or rigorous word unto him; but onely

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> uttered this remonſtrance. <q>I am abaſhed, <hi>Plautianus,</hi> how it came in thine heart to enterpriſe this againſt me, who have ſo much loved and exalted thee, and againſt my children, whereof <hi>Baſsianus</hi> my eldeſt ſonne hath married your daughter, and ſo is your ſonne in law. Truly the condition of men is very miſerable, that cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelves in ſuch honour and dignitie, as I have placed you in. I pray you tell me your reaſons &amp; defences to purge you of this act.</q> The aboveſaid <hi>Baſsianus</hi> (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the emperour his father would receive <hi>Plautianus</hi> to his juſtification, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he ſhould have eſcaped) cauſed one of his men to ſlay him in the preſence of his father, adding to the ſaying of <hi>Severus:</hi> Certaine it is, that great honors attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to one man alone (as to governe the affaires of a kingdome) not only makes him go out of the bonds of reaſon, but alſo ſubjects him unto great envies, wherby great miſcheefes happen unto him.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Philip le Bell,</hi> king of Fraunce, <hi>M. Enguerrant de Marigni,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Annal. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>An.</hi> 1314 <hi>&amp;</hi> 1326.</note> 
                        <hi>de Longuevile,</hi> a valiant and wiſe knight, governed almoſt all the affaires of the king and his kingdome, and eſpecially of his common treaſure, which was diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ordinance. Amongſt other things he cauſed to build that great Pallace at Paris, where the court of parliament is held.

This happened onely unto him by the envie he had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his great place and too great credit. For true it is, that he was accuſed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, but he was not condemned of any puniſhable thing. But our hyſtories ſay, That he was not received unto his juſtifications and defences, he was ſo fiercely purſued by the ſaid Countie <hi>de Valois,</hi> who after he had cauſed him to bee hanged, and that the hatred he bore him was extinct by his death, from thence forward hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> repented and greatly greeved, and ordinarily felt his conſcience tormented therwith. After, falling ſicke, hee had a perſuaſion, that it was a puniſhment ſent him of God for the death of <hi>M.

it is, to wound our conſcience, for to pleaſe our affections. For that is to offend the

They then ſay, That a Prince ought not to give truſt to them which are ſtrangers unto him, and which are of another countrey and nation than he; but ought altogether (if it can be) ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with them of his owne nation, yea, and that in the government of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and provinces of another nation that is ſubject unto him. As the kings of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland did in the time, when they held Guienne, Normandie, the Iſle of Fraunce, the moſt part of Picardie: for they gave the governments and offices of all thoſe provinces unto Engliſhmen, as beeing of their owne nation, and not unto French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which were ſtrangers unto them: as alſo did and doth the king of Spaine, who being borne in Spaine, yet holds many goodly countries of other nations, as the low countries, Burgundie, or the free Countie, the dutchie of Millaine, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Sicilie, and of Naples, but the governours and magiſtrates there, are all or the moſt part Spaniards.

                     <p>The reaſon is evident, becauſe naturally every man loves his owne countrie and nation, and by conſequent, a governour or magiſtrate of the ſame nation, and of that countrey, ſhall bee better beloved than a ſtranger. And being better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, he ſhall alſo be better obeyed, and ſhall ſo bring a better obedience to his prince: for true and aſſured obedience muſt proceed more from love, than from force or feare, as ſhall be ſhewed more at large in another place. The other reaſon

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> is, That other nations are different in manners and complexions, whereunto Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates muſt accommodate and apply themſelves; and if they be ſtrangers, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can nor know how to doe it. I will not therefore ſay, that magiſtrates ought to be of the ſame towne or of the ſame province, but onely of the ſame nation. For contrarie, I thinke, that the ordinance of the auncient Romanes and of our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient kings was good, That none ſhould governe in that Province where hee was borne; becauſe having there his friends and parents, he would ſooner employ his office to favour them, than others. That office alſo might ſo be more contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being exerciſed by one of the ſame place, whoſe familiar and privat knowledge may make him leſſe honoured of his neighbours. I will not ſay alſo, but that a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> prince, which poſſeſſeth ſome countries of another nation &amp; tongue than his owne, ought and may have certaine officers and magiſtrates of his owne nation, as a lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall and captaines of fortreſſes: but he ſhould the moſt hee poſſibly can ſerve himſelfe with them of the countrey: yea, his lieutenant Generall ought often to communicate with them, and to call them to counſell. For the eſtate of a prince is no other thing than the eſtate of a Commonwealth: for as much as the power which the people had in &amp; upon themſelves, they have tranſported unto the prince: ſo that the prince ought to have the care (as he hath the authoritie) over all affaires which touch the conſervation and encreaſe of the eſtate and good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale. But although that care do truly appertaine to the prince, yet his ſubjects have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> a great intereſt, that he acquite himſelfe well and duly, becauſe the domage &amp; harme fals upon them, if he doe evill. And therefore this makes, that they are alwayes deſirous to know how the prince governeth himſelfe, and when the prince dooth them this honour, to call them unto ſome participation of that charge, they receive a great contentment, and doe love greatly their prince, and the more willingly doe yeeld him obedience. But if the prince deſpiſe them, and give them no offices, but give them to people which are not of their owne nation, they receive a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment; and for that thereby they preſume, that the prince truſts them not, they thereupon inferre, that they love them not. But hard it is to love, where hee is not beloved. Hereof ariſe afterward, enterpriſes, rebellions, revolts, &amp; other broiles,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which wee ſee alwayes happen either ſoone or late, when ſubjects are miſcontented with their prince. There is yet another reaſon, which is; That naturally men deſire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which of it ſelfe is no evill, nor condemnable appetite. For all they that love vertue, are alwayes touched with that deſire, not to be honoured themſelves, but to the end, that vertue may bee had in that eſtimation that it deſerveth. And therefore when the prince ſhutteth the gate to honors from them of his nation, the vertuous
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21818:41"/>
people thereof are angry, and doe greeve, that they have not whereupon and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in to employ and make eſteeme of their vertue, namely, a good ſpirit and prudence, which are beſt employed, and ſhine more in a publicke than in an houſhold-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. From hence it alſo comes, that vertuous people beeing angry and chafed to ſee themſelves deſpiſed, as alſo to ſee ſtrangers preferred before them, ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be governed and guided by turbulent paſſions, contrarie to their natures. Moreover, it ſeemeth well, that the Poet <hi>Heſiodius</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſhoot not farre from the white of truth: when they ſay, That by right of nature he ought to dominier and rule, who hath the more able ſpirit to know how to command well, and he that hath the leſſeable ought to obey. And although ſovereign principalities are not ruled by that naturall law, becauſe of the difficultie which falleth ordinarily in the execution

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of their election: yet for all that, that law alwayes ſticketh naturally in the ſpirits and minds of men: inſomuch, as it ſeemes to them, which feele themſelves to have ſome ſufficiencie, that there is wrong done them, when they are put by, to bring into an office one leſſe capable. By the aboveſaid reaſons then, I hope men may ſee, and uſually we reade, how great diſorders doe often come, when princes have preferred ſtrangers unto publicke charges, offices and honours, before them of that nation and countrey, where ſuch charges and honours are diſtributed and exerciſed.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of all the people, and of the moſt part of the Nobilitie of that countrey, as a Meſſias ſent of God, to deliver them from the cruell and barbarous tyrannie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were before, and had now long time beene under their kings, <hi>Alphonſus</hi> and <hi>Ferrand</hi> of Arragon, uſurpers of that kingdome upon the houſe of Anjou, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Charles</hi> ſucceeded. Every one may judge, if it had not beene eaſie for the king (if he had enjoyed a good Counſell) to have kept that goodly kingdome in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall obedience. For when a people hath been tyrannized by an uſurper, and that he comes to recover his naturall prince, which deales with them like a good prince, there is nothing to induce the people to denie him obeiſance, or to revolt. Becauſe on the one ſide they acknowledge, that after God, and reaſon, they ought to obey

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him, which is the true and lawfull prince, unto whom alwayes there is more amitie borne, than unto another: and on the other ſide, they ſee themſelves diſcharged and unburdened of that heavie waight of tyrannie and of an uſurper. But what came there unto king <hi>Charles?</hi> Thus having conquered that kingdome, hee gave all the eſtates and offices of the country unto Frenchmen, which he had with him in that voyage: whereof the gentlemen of the countrey, (and eſpecially ſuch as had alwaies either ſecretly or openly held to the part of the houſe of Anjou) were ſo diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſpighted, that they ſtraight caſt off all amitie &amp; good affection to the king, and incontinent entred into practiſes and complots, to make all the countrey to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, which they ſtraight did, and ſo made void that voyage, and (for nothing) the

                     <p>By the aforeſaid example it appeares, That the Frenchmen gained nothing by getting into their hands all the offices and eſtates of the kingdome of Naples: yet gained they much leſſe in the fact I come now to ſpeake of, ſeeking to take away the honour of the warre from the Spaniards in Spaine at the battaile of Iuberoth.

The Caſtilians contradicted this, beeing greeved and envious againſt the French, that ſo vaunted &amp; preferred themſelves before them. Notwithſtanding all that the Spaniards could doe, the king graunted them their requeſt, where of they were very glad, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21818:43"/>
as ſad. What did the Caſtilians? Vpon deſpight and envie they complot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> together, to ſuffer the French to purſue the enemie without following or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding them, but onely to make a ſhew, that they would follow them, to the end, that all the glorie might remaine to the French, if they vanquiſhed, or all to them, if after the overthrowing of the French, they were victors. Vpon which reſolution, it is well to note, how envie and hatred blindeth judgement. For if they had not been very paſſionate, they might well judge, That forces devided, might eaſily be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed one after another, (as it happened to their ruine and diſhonour) and to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the French) but being joyned together, they might much ſooner have beene victorious. Finally, the battaile was given againſt the Portugals, which were vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly encountred by the French, but beeing unſeconded by the Caſtilians, which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> held the arreregard, they were found the more feeble: inſomuch, that they were all ſlaine or taken. And which was a thing very lamentable: Of thoſe there were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand gentlemen taken priſoners, amongſt which there were nineteene great lords, all which alſo were thus ſlaine. For as the Portugals, a while after the defeating of the avantgard of the French, perceived to arrive the arreregard of the Caſtilians, they reſolved to ſlay their priſoners, and did ſo, leſt they either ſhould make warre upon them behind, or els eſcape. So having ſlaine all their ſaid priſoners, they marched valiantly againſt the Caſtilians, whom they likewiſe diſcomfited. If we Frenchmen had not been ſo ambitious and covetous of glorie, as to ſeeke glorie in a ſtrangers countrey, above them of that countrey, they had not falne into this miſcheefe.

                           <hi>De Comines, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 83, 92.</note> towne of Nus, entred into diſtruſt and diſcontentment with his owne ſubjects, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in truth they had done all their duties in the beſiege of the towne: yet a prince muſt doe what hee will. Vpon this miſtruſt and diſcontentment of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, hee reſolved with himſelfe to bee ſerved with ſtrangers, and amongſt all other ſtrange nations, he made choice of Italians. But I leave you to thinke how good his choice was likely to be: for every one knowes well ynough, what account Italians make of the obſervation of their faith, and how <hi>Machiavell</hi> teacheth, That faith is not to be obſerved but to a mans profit, which they of that nation doe alwayes well practiſe. And if ſometimes there bee found any loyall and good obſervers of their

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> promiſe, it is a thing ſo rare, as that raritie ſhould not have any thing mooved the duke of Burgoigne, rather to truſt the Italians, than his own proper ſubjects. Yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken it in hand, he drew to his ſervice the earle of Campobache, which hee entertained with foure hundred men of arms &amp; more of Italians paied by his hands. Incontinent as <hi>Campobache</hi> was entred into credit with the duke, hee begun to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne him at his pleaſure, ſo that the duke truſted more in him than in any man in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21818:44"/>
the world. <hi>Campobache</hi> having gained this point, ſtraight begun to practiſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> him, and to deliver him to king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, then raigning, if hee would promiſe him in recompence 20000 crownes, and a good earledome. But the king (doing as <hi>Fabricius</hi> did towards the king <hi>Pyrrhus)</hi> would not enter into that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but advertiſed the duke of Burgoigne; to the end he might take heed of that traitor, and rid himſelfe of him. The duke tooke this advertiſement in evill part (his ſences were ſo troubled) imagining, that the king ſent him this word to make him leeſe his good ſervants, and therefore truſted more than ever, <hi>Campobache.</hi> When <hi>Campobache</hi> ſaw hee could not bargaine with the king, hee ſought a merchant other where: for hee was reſolved, whatſoever became of his credit, to draw out a profit, if he could. Amongſt theſe actions, the duke thought good to beſiege Nancy, the principall towne of Lorraine. The duke of Lorraine was not ſo ſcrupulous to enter

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> into compoſition with that traitor, as the king had been, eſpecially, becauſe the duke of Burgoigne made warre upon him unjuſtly, and ſought to take from him his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. He therefore entred into compact with <hi>Campobache,</hi> by the meanes of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of his, named <hi>Cyfron,</hi> and they concluded and agreed betwixt them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly. Finally, before Nancy was a battaile given by the advice of <hi>Campobache,</hi> who councelled the duke of Lorraine, to levie the ſiege of the duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goigne, who was there ſlaine, and his armie defeated by the meanes and treaſon of <hi>Campobache.</hi> The king after this, tooke a part of the countrey of the ſaid duke of Burgoigne, which died in the foreſaid battaile, becauſe they ought duly for

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> want of heires male to returne to the Crowne of Fraunce; and the reſt of his dukedome fell to his onely daughter, who was his heire, which was married in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of Auſtriche. Now you may ſee how the duke of Burgoigne did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate himſelfe into ruine, and his countries fell as a prey unto his neighbours, by truſting ſtraungers, and forſaking his good, faithfull, and naturall ſubjects and vaſſales.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Carres, Niſibis, and other great townes which the Perſians held: inſomuch, that the name of <hi>Gordian</hi> was feared and redoubted through all Perſia, whereas before Italie it ſelfe begun to feare the Perſians. But upon the courſe of his victories and proſperities, arrived by evill hap the death of that good and wiſe man <hi>Miſitheus,</hi> and withall, fell another yet greater, which was this: That that young emperour went to give the eſtate of his father in law to a ſtranger, an Arabian, called <hi>Phillippus,</hi> who ſtraight begun to practiſe againſt his maſter (as we have aboveſaid of <hi>Campobache.)</hi> For the firſt thing he did was this: That he tooke order, that victuals ſhould want in the campe, to make a mutinie of the ſouldiers againſt the emperour, and hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did ſow diffamatorie words through the campe againſt his maſter, as that hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> was a young man, and knew not what belonged to the conduction of a campe, and merited not to be an emperour, and who would cauſe all the armie to be deſtroyed, if they reſted upon him. Breefely, he brought the ſouldiers and men of war to what point he would, by the meanes he tooke. For there is nothing more ſaucie nor more deafe to heare reaſons and excuſes, than an hungrie bellie. All the hoaſt then being angry againſt <hi>Gordian,</hi> for the want of victuals; and the principall captaines thereof
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21818:44"/>
being corrupted by this Arabian ſtranger, he did ſo much, as he got himſelfe to bee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> choſen as tutor and governour of the emperour. Haying by this meanes gained the authoritie to command, he begun to enterpriſe to make <hi>Gordian</hi> his maſter die. Which this young prince ſeeing, he beſought him humbly, that hee would receive him into the participation of the empire, and that they two might be together em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: as but a few yeares before had been <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus.</hi> But <hi>Philippus</hi> would not agree to that, perceiving himſelfe ſtrong of captaines, which hee had gained and corrupted. Then <hi>Gordian</hi> demanded of him yet the office which he had given him of the Great maſter of his houſhold, &amp; Lieutenant generall, &amp; that in the place of a maſter he might ſo be his ſervant. But the fierce Arabian denied it him, he was ſo villanous and ingrate. Finally, he deſired him but to ſave his life, which likewiſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that wicked Arabian would not accord, fearing that one day he might trouble him, becauſe he was of a very noble race, and that he had many friends as well at Rome, as all over the Roman empire: and by the contrarie, <hi>Philippus</hi> was of a vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known race. Breefely, this cruell Barbarian &amp; ſtranger, made forcibly to be brought before his face that young prince, his maſter, who had advanced him, and there cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be unclothed naked, and ſo to be maſſacred and ſlaine. Would any ſay, there could be imagined a barbarouſneſſe, diſloyaltie, or crueltie, more ſtrange? ſo a ſtranger committed it. Truſt ſuch people who liſt.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Romans which were wiſe, tooke good heed of granting charges and offices unto ſtrangers, nay not to their aſſociates of the ſame tongue that they were.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> After they had loſt the battaile of Cannas, where were ſlaine foureſcore Senators, the Senate ſeemed to be utterly overthrowne, the number remaining was ſo ſmall. There was then propoſed by <hi>Marcus Aemilius,</hi> Praetor, that there ſhould be new Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators choſen to ſupply and encreaſe the auncient number. And upon this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he as preſident of the Senate, demaunded firſt the advice of <hi>Spurius Carvilius,</hi> Senatour. <hi>Carvilius</hi> thought beſt to chuſe ſome good number of the moſt notable and wiſe men of the Latines, their aſſociates; as well for that there was want of men within Rome, as to hold the Latines more united and obedient; by the meanes of which union he ſaid, the Commonwealth ſhould be much more fortified &amp; encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But <hi>Manlius,</hi> which reaſoned after him, was of another advice: for hee declared

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> high and clear, That the firſt Latine that he ſaw enter within the Senat to ſit down as Senator, he would ſlay him with his owne hand; and he could never endure, that the Senat ſhould be contaminated with ſtrangers. After <hi>Manlius,</hi> reaſoned that wiſe lord <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus,</hi> who ſaid, he never heard nor ſaw any man argue in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat ſo groſſely and evill to purpoſe as <hi>Carvilius</hi> had done, eſpecially (ſaid hee) in this time wherein we are brought to ſuch extremitie, and that it is more needfull than ever, to have in the Senat, faithfull and loyall perſons: and every one may well know, that there can never be good truſt and aſſurance in ſtrangers, which meaſure faith and loyaltie, by their profit and loſſe. We had need alſo to take good heed there be no brute or fame of this fooliſh opinion of <hi>Carvilius,</hi> but to let it bee trodden under

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our feet, for feare the Latines take not occaſion to lift up their horns, if they perceive any wind or breath thereof. Breefely, all the companie were of this opinion, and 177 Senators were choſen out of the body of the town of Rome, which before had made known their vertue without more looking into the nobilitie of their race. And <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius</hi> was much deſpited, that he would have advanced ſtrangers into the offices of Senators.</p>

We muſt not be abaſhed if the ancient Romanes have uſed this: for even at this

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> day there is not ſo ſmall a commonwealth that uſeth it not. See Veniſe, Gennes, and other townes of Italie, which are in forme of commonwealths; ſee Strasburg, Nuremburg, Ausburg, Francfort, Magdeburg, and all the imperiall townes of Almaigne, which are governed like commonwealths, and the thirteene cantons of the Suiſſes, you ſhall find, that they ſtraitly obſerve this rule, To receive no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into offices and publicke charges: yea, in many places they will not receive ſtrangers for inhabitants, wherein (it may be) they hold too much ſeveritie and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. For hoſpitalitie is recommended unto us of God, and it is a very laudable vertue for men to entertaine ſtrangers, and well to uſe them in entertainement. But ſtrangers alſo ought to content themſelves to be welcommed and entertained in a countrey or towne, without an aſpiring will to maſter or hold offices and eſtates:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> for at the length, that can obtaine unto them but envie and evill will. The French nation is that, which of all chriſtianitie (as I thinke) receiveth and loveth ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers moſt: for they are as welcome all over Fraunce, as they of their owne nation. Yet wee have above ſhewed, that our predeceſſors were ſometimes miſcontented with the Engliſhmen, that would needs have all eſtates and offices in Aquitaine, as much may happen in this time: for nothing hath beene in times paſt, which may not againe be in this time.</p>
                     <p>The Salicke law (which is obſerved in Fraunce, and through all Almaigne) was not onely made to fore-cloſe and barre women from the ſucceſſion of the crowne,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and from ſoveraigne domination, by reaſon of the imbecilitie and incapacitie well to commaund, which is in the feminine ſex: for in the maſculine ſexe happen often ſuch incapacities. But eſpecially the Salicke law was made, to the end, That by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages ſtrangers ſhould not come to the ſaid ſucceſſion of the Crowne. For it ſhould be as an intollerable thing to a Frenchman, to obey a ſtrange king, as to obey a queene of the French nation, ſo odious is a ſtrange domination in Fraunce. As alſo for that the conſequence thereof with us ſhould be ever evill. For a ſtrange king would alwayes to eſtates and offices of the kingdome advaunce ſtraungers of his nation; a thing which would alwayes cauſe in the end diſorders and confuſions, as is ſeene by the examples which we have before diſcovered.

This was the cauſe of an evill enterpriſe of theſe three young princes againſt their owne father. For they ſeized upon his perſon, and brought him into the towne of Soi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſons, and there cauſed him to forſake his crowne of Fraunce, and the Eſtate of the empire, and to take the habit of a monke in the Abbey of S. <hi>Marke</hi> in the ſaid

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Soiſſons, within which they cauſed him to be kept ſtraitly for a time. But in the end the great barons and lords of Fraunce and Almaigne medled therein, and diſmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, and reſtored him to his Eſtate, and agreed the father with the children. This had not happened, if that good king and emperour had had that wiſedome, not to have lifted up a ſtranger ſo high; a thing which could not be but diſpleaſant to his naturall ſubjects, great and little.</p>
                     <p>For a concluſion of this matter, I will here place the witneſſe of <hi>M. Martin du Bellay,</hi> knight of the kings order, a man of qualitie, of vertue, and of great experience, who ſayth: That hee hath ſeene in his time more evill happen unto the affaires of king <hi>Francis,</hi> the firſt of that name, by the meanes of ſtraungers,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which revolted from his ſervice, than by any other meanes. Amongſt which ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers <note place="margin">Strangers enclined to commit treaſons.</note> hee placeth the Biſhop de Liege, the Prince of Orange, the Marqueſſe of Mantua, the Lord <hi>Andrew Doria, M. Ierome Moron</hi> of Millaine, (who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Millaine to revolt) and certaine others. But becauſe theſe things are not of very auncient memorie, but happened in our world, I will make no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thereof. Seeing alſo the examples and reaſons which wee have above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, are ſufficient to ſhew (againſt the opinion of <hi>Machiavell</hi> his diſciples:) That a Prince cannot doe better, than to ſerve himſelfe (in offices and publicke charges of the countrey of his domination) with his owne ſubjects of the ſame countries, as beeing more fit and agreeing to the nature of the people of that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> countrey, than are ſtrangers. And there is not a more odious thing to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (as <hi>M.

And as for offices, it hath not beene ſeene aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and commonly, that they have beene beſtowed upon ſtraungers: but that within this little ſpace of time they have found meanes to obtaine the greateſt and beſt. For of old there was committed unto them, but offices of Captaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, to the end, that under that title they might the better draw people of their owne countrey to ſerve the king. But as for benefices, of a long time it hath been, that the Italians have held and poſſeſſed the beſt in Fraunce, which the Pope beſtowed upon them, and our kings durſt not well contradict. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it gave occaſion unto king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, to make an edict in the yeare 1356, whereby hee forbad, That any benefices of the kingdome of France ſhould be conferred upon ſtrangers; which both before and ſince, by many royall Edicts, hath often beene renued and reiterated.

But I pray here all them which are good Frenchmen, that they will conſider a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> neerer the wrong they do themſelves, to ſuffer themſelves to be reputed for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their owne countrie, and by that meanes recuiled and kept from the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Eſtates of the ſame. For Italians, or ſuch as are Italianized (which have in their hands the governance of France) hold for true the Maxime of <hi>Machiavell:</hi> That men ſhould not truſt in ſtrangers, as it is true: and this is becauſe they would not advance any other but men onely of their owne nation, and certaine baſtardlie and degenerous Frenchmen, which are faſhioned, both to their humour and their faſhions, and which may ſerve them as ſlaves and moſt vile miniſters of their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, cruelties, rapines, and other vices. For as for good and naturall French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they will never advaunce them, becauſe they are ſtrangers vnto them, and by

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> conſequent ſuſpected not to bee faithfull enough unto them, following the ſaid Maxime.</p>
                     <p>Where is now then the generoſitie of our ancient Frenchmen, who made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves redoubted amongſt ſtrange nations? Where are now our aunceſtors vertues, who have cauſed the Levant to tremble, &amp; have ſent out their reputation into Aſia, and hath repulſed and driven back the Gothes and Sarracens out of France, Spaine and Italie? For it ſeemeth that at this day the Frenchmen hold no more any thing of their anceſtors valour, ſeeing they ſuffer (in compariſon to them) ſo few ſtrangers to dominiere ſo imperiouſly over them, and ſo to debaſe themſelves, and to carry on their backes ſuch inſupportable burdens, and to ſuffer themſelves to be driven from

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the Charges and Eſtates of the common-wealth. Truly this is farre from making us to be redoubted and obeyed in ſtrange countries, when ſtrangers conſtreine us to obey them, and to take the yoke in our owne countrie. This is to doe cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to our aunceſtors, who ſubjected ſtrangers unto them, when contrarie we ſubject our owne ſelves to ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>The Frenchmen were wont to be reputed franke &amp; liberall, far from all ſervitude; but now our ſtupiditie, careleſneſſe &amp; cowardize do make us ſervants &amp; ſlaves to the moſt daſtardly &amp; cowardly nation of Chriſtendome. Our anceſtors have vanquiſhed and ſubjugated in battaile, &amp; by armes, great Italian armies; but we ſuffer our ſelves to be over come by a ſmall number of Italians armed with a rock, a ſpindle, and a pen

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and inckhorne. Shall we alwayes be thus bewitched? ſee we not that by ſecret and and unknowne meanes they overthrow, and cauſe to die by treaſons, poyſonings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, now one, now another, of the greateſt? &amp; that they looke to no other marke but to ruinate the nobilitie, and all men of valour in France, which are ſuſpected to favour the common-weale, or diſfavour them? Be ſleepie no longer, for it is time to awake, and to thinke what we have to doe, and not to attend till (from the particular ruine now of one houſe, then of another) we ſee all France vpon the earth. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie but too much eſtabliſhed? and we have but too long attended to provide for our affairs, and to oppoſe our ſelves againſt the deſeignes and machinations of theſe ſtrangers, all which are diſcovered and knowne to ſuch as will not ſhut their eyes. Let

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ought to employ his Counſell; namely, That the true and pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of God be knowne; and being knowne, that it bee obſerved by him and all his ſubiects. <hi>Machiavell</hi> in this caſe (as a very Atheiſt and contemner of God) giveth another document to a prince: for he would, That a prince ſhould not care, whether the Religion that he holdeth be true or falſe; but ſayth, That he ought to ſupport and favour ſuch falſities as are found therein: And hee comes even to this point (as an abhominable and wicked blaſphemer) that he preferreth the Religion of the Paynims before the Christian: and yet his booke is not condemned as hereticall by our Sorbonists. But before we enter to confute his deteſtable Maximes, I will in manner of a Preface, demonſtrat in few words the true reſolution that a prince ought to have in

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> this matter. I preſuppoſe then by a certaine Maxime, That the prince ought to hold the Christian Religion, as it is ſeene, by all antiquitie, ſimplicitie, and excellencie of doctrine. For in the firſt place; none can deny but it is more ancient tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other of all the Religions <note place="margin">Antiquitie of Chriſtian Religion.</note> that ever were: becauſe it takes his foundation upon the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, of Christ and <hi>Meſſias,</hi> contained in them bookes, which were made to our first Fathers, from the beginning of the world. But there is no author, Greeke or Latine, which was not long after <hi>Moſes:</hi> and it is a thing confeſſed and held amongst all learned men, That <hi>Moſes</hi> writ his bookes many hundred years before <hi>Homer, Beroſus, Heſiodus, Manethon, Metaſthenes,</hi> and others like, which many men hold for the moſt aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers. Moreover, when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth unto us the generation of <hi>Noe,</hi> and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſheweth us that his children have bene as the first ſtem and root of divers nations of the world (in token and ſigne thereof, theſe nations hold yet at this preſent, the names of ſuch children) doth not this ſhew plainly and truly, that <hi>Moſes</hi> begun at the worlds beginning? Of <hi>Madens</hi> came the Medians, of <hi>Ianus</hi> the Ionians, of <hi>Iobel</hi> the Iberians, of <hi>Riphat</hi> the Riphaeans, of <hi>Tigran</hi> the Tigranians, of <hi>Tharſis</hi> the Tharſians, of <hi>Cithin</hi> the Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of <hi>Canaan</hi> the Cananites, of <hi>Sidon</hi> the Sidonians, of <hi>Elam</hi> the Elamites, of <hi>Aſſur</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:21818:47"/>
the Aſsyrians; of <hi>Lud</hi> the Lydians and others: all theſe were the children, nephews, or

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> arrere-nephews of <hi>Noe,</hi> from whence the ſaid nations have taken their names: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therefore, that they were the first ſtocks and roots of them. Againe, if we looke to the ceremonies that in times past the Paynims uſed in their ſacrifices, men ſhall eaſily know, that they are but apiſh imitations of ſuch ſacrifices as were ordained of God, which are deſcribed by <hi>Moſes:</hi> For the ſacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia</hi> which the Graecians made in Aulide to proſper them in the war they enterpriſed againſt Troy; what other thing is it than an imitation of <hi>Iepthe</hi> his ſacrifice? who made a vow of a ſacrifice; to proſper him in the war he enterpriſed; which ſacrifice fell after by the divine will, upon his owne daughter. The cuſtome which the Gaulois and many other people had, to immolat and offer criminall men when they had an opinion that God was angrie with them; what other thing was it but a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> following of the ſacrifice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the ſacrifices that God had commaunded for the expiation of ſinnes? The Paynims alſo imitated this of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſacrifices, that they immolated the like beasts, and reſerved alſo a part of the beaſt ſacrificed, to eat. So that thereby alſo it is clearly ſeene, That the Religion of <hi>Moſes</hi> is the primitive and first, and that the other religions are but fowle and lazie pourtratures and imitations thereof. From hence followeth it, That our Chriſtian Religion (which draweth his principles from the promiſes of <hi>Meſſias,</hi> contained in <hi>Moſes)</hi> is the most ancient of the world, yea as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the world it ſelfe. For I wil not vouchſafe to ſtay upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the refutation of the ſtrange opinion of <hi>Machiavell</hi> and other ancient Philoſophers Paynims; which have maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, That the world had no beginning: but I ſend them to <hi>Empedocles, Plato,</hi> and other ancient Paynim Philoſophers which have maintained the contrarie. I thinke that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the ignorance of the philoſophers, which held, That the world had no beginning, ſhal ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing excuſe them, becauſe they never ſaw the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in a thing ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile and hard to comprehend, the ſpirits of men might eaſily faile. But the impietie of <hi>Machiavel</hi> is no way excuſable, who hath ſeene the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; yet followeth that wicked opinion, like a mocker and contemner of the holy Scripture, thinking to ſhew, that he knowes more than others, he I ſay, who is ignorant and full of brutiſh beaſtlineſſe, as (God willing) I ſhall make knowne.</p>
               <p>As for the ſimplicitie of the Christian Religion, herein it is ſeene, That the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">Simplicitie of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> will know God, as he will that we ſhould know him; and as he hath manifested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> unto us, ſimply, without paſsing further. For they are not ſo preſumptuous as were thoſe fooliſh Paynim philoſophers which diſputed of the Eſſence of God, and diſputing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that point, fell into opinions, the moſt abſurd and ſtrange of the world. Some, after they had much dreamed in their brains, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, That the univerſall world was God: others, That it was the Soule of the world: others, That it was the Sun: and others ſet forward certaine other like monſtrous opinions. They diſputed alſo of his Power, of his Eternitie, and of his Providence, by naturall reaſons: in all theſe they knew not how to reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein: For how is man ſo prowd and inſenſible, to thinke, that his braine (which is not halfe a foot large) can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend ſo great and infinit a thing? it is as great a foolery and groſeneſſe, as he that in the palme of his hand will comprehend all the waters of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſea. A Christian then hath this modestie and ſimplicitie, To know God by thoſe means and according as he will be known of men; beleeving, That to have a wil to paſſe further, is to enter into darkneſſe, &amp; not into knowledge. From hence followeth it, That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which a Christian hath of God, is the only true knowledge; and that all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that others (as Paynims and Philoſophers) ever had, it neither was nor is any other but a ſhadow and imagination, very far from the most part of the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:21818:48"/>
And touching the excellencie of the doctrine of true Religion, herein is it firſt ſeene;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
                  <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Chriſtian Religion.</note> that it is founded upon the promiſes of God made to the firſt fathers from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world: whereby all they that embrace that Religion, are aſſured, That God is their father, and that he loveth them, and that hee will give them eternall life by the meanes of <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Can there then be any thing more excellent than this? Is there any thing in the world that can give more contentment or repoſe to the ſpirit of man, than this doctrine? For when man conſidereth the brevitie of his dayes, the languiſhments and miſeries of this world, full of envies, enemities, all vices and calamities, will hee not iudge himſelfe more unhappie than the beaſts, if hee hoped not for an eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe after this life? The poore Paynims having this conſideration, aſpired to an eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſome in doing worthy acts, wherof there ſhould be a perpetuall memorie after them;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> others writ bookes that might bee read after their death: others perſuaded themſelves, that the gods would ſend good mens ſoules into the Eliſian fields, and the wicked into the Acherontike and Stigian darkeneſse. Yet were there ſome Philoſophers, which diſputed; <note place="margin">Cice. in Somn. Scipi. Plato in Phaedo.</note> That the ſoules of generous and valiant men after death, goe to heaven. All theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and perſuaſions of men, were but to give reſt to their minds, which iudged man of all creatures moſt unhappie, without an eternall life after this. But what aſſurance had they of theſe opinions, which they gave to themſelves? Theſe poore people had none, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther founded they themſelves, but upon ſome weake and feeble reaſons. For thus they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued: That it was not credible, that God, who is all good, would create man (who is the moſt excellent creature in the world) to make him moſt unhappie, which hee ſhould doe, if

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> he ſhould not enioy an happie and eternall life after this. They alſo ſay, That it is not credible, that God, which is all iuſt, would equally deale with the good as with the bad: which he ſhould doe, if there were not another life than this, wherein the good might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a felicitie, and the wicked puniſhment for their miſdeeds. But what is all this? Theſe be but feeble and weake pettie reaſons, wherupon the ſpirits and conſciences of men can find no good foundation to repoſe themſelves, and to take an aſſured reſolution of a ſalvation and an eternall felicitie. But the Chriſtian hath another foundation than this: for he knoweth that God is of old, gone out (if I may ſo ſay) from his throne in heaven to communicate and manifeſt himſelfe to our auncient fathers, to ſpeake vnto them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto them his bountie and love towards mankind; hee knowes, that God hath made

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> them promiſes of <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which he hath ſince accompliſhed, and that in him he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give eternall life to all them which lay hold of that <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and uſe his meanes to come unto it. Theſe promiſes have ben many times reiterated to our ſaid fathers, and in ages well diſtant one from another, that they might not be forgotten, but that they might be ſo much the more cleare, and known of every one: inſomuch, that the Paynims themſelves (which never read our fathers writings) have had ſome knowledge of the promiſes of God touching <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they were ſo cleare, not orious and well knowne, as we ſhall ſay more at full in another place. Heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a reſolution, a great excellencie in this doctrine of Christian Religion, viz. what it brings us to a certain knowledge and a firme aſſurance of an eternall life after this; which knowledge and aſſurance is not founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> certaine leane Phyloſophicall reaſons, but upon the promiſes proceeding from the very mouth of God, which is the truth it ſelfe, and cannot lie.</p>
               <p>And as for the doctrine of maners, I confeſſe that the Paynims and Philoſophers which have held other religions, have ſpoken and reaſoned in reaſonable good tearms; but yet their doctrine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth nothing nigh to that which the Christian Religion teacheth us thereof. True it is that the Paynims have ſpoken ſomething well of Iustice, Temperance,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21818:48"/>
Clemencie, Prudence, Loyaltie, Fidelitie, Amitie, Gentleneſſe, Magnanimitie, Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Love towards ones countrie, and ſuch other vertues; he that denieth that they have not ſpoken well, and that ſome have not ſomething practiſed them, ſhould do them wrong. And the Chriſtians have this in common with them, To approve and follow all theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and for that cauſe they diſdaine not to reade their bookes, and to learne of them the goodlie documents which they have left, touching theſe vertues: but yet I must ſay, that the Christian Religion hath lanched and entred farre deeper into the doctrine of good manners, then the Paynims and Philoſophers have done. For proofe hereof I will take the Maxime of <hi>Plato:</hi> That we are not only borne for our ſelves, but that our birth is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for our countrie, partlie for our parents, and partlie for our friends: behold a goodlie ſentence we can ſay no other: but if we come to conferre it with the doctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it will be found maimed and defective. For what mention doth <hi>Plato</hi> make of the poore? where and in what place of this notable ſentence doth he ſet them? he ſpeakes not at all of them: breefly, he would that our charitie ſhould bee first employed towards our ſelves: which they have well marked &amp; followed, which ſay; That a well ordered charitie begins at himſelfe. But this is farre from the doctrine which <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, when he ſayth: That Charitie ſeeks not her owne; and alſo that which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe commaundeth us; To love our neighbour as our ſelves. Secondly, <hi>Plato</hi> placeth our love towards our countrey: Thirdly, our love towards our parents: and lastly, our friends. And what becomes of the poore? Let them doe as they can: for <hi>Plato</hi> his Charitie ſtretcheth not to them. And indeed a poore perſon, in the time of the Paynims, which had

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> no meanes to live, had no ſhorter way then to ſell himſelfe to be a ſlave unto him that bought him, who afterward ſerved himſelfe with him and nouriſhed him. If ſuch a poore man found no man to buy him, he died with hunger. True it is, that ſome were ſometimes touched with commiſeration of humanitie towards poore perſons, when they ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their eies languiſhing and in miſerie: but they called not this commiſſeration a vertue, but only an humane paſsion. Neither had they any hoſpitals to lodge and nouriſh the poore in, nor their princes or great lords had their Almoniers as Christians have. When a child was borne evill formed, they would kill it, a cruell thing and full of inhumanitie, yet was it ordinarily practiſed; yea at Rome it was an expreſſe law of <hi>Romulus,</hi> whereby he <note place="margin">Dioniſ. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licar. lib. 2.</note> commanded to expoſe and ſtifle the children which were borne disformed; which not only

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was a crueltie against nature, but as it were a deſpite and iniurie done to the Creator who had created and formed them. They made accompt of poore men as they did of beasts: for they ſlew their ſlaves at their pleaſure, and when, and for what they would. <hi>Vedius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dion in Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſto.</note> 
                  <hi>Polio</hi> a Romane gentleman in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> ordinarilie cauſed to ſley his ſervants and ſlaves (wherof he had a great number (in chooſing alwaies the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, to cast the other bodies into his ponds which he had nigh his houſe, to feede Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preis which he had in thoſe ponds. In the Paynims time (to offer pleaſure &amp; pastime to the people) they cauſed to make Theaters for combats to vttrance of poore ſlaves, which they cauſed to bande in two parts one against an other, and after that, furiouſly ſet one upon an other with naked ſwords, and none of them armed with any defenſive thing. And (this

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſport ended) when they of the one part had ſlaine all the others, or elſe that all had ſlaine one another to the laſt, the people laughed and tooke pleaſure to ſee this, no more nor no leſſe than we take pleaſure to ſee Cocks fight. Hereby is it ſeene that the Paynims had no pitie of the poore, nor of ſlaves &amp; ſervants, but regarded them as brute beasts, and made no more accompt of them, but for their ſervice they drew from them. Alſo we never read amongst all their morrall precepts they had, that they ever ſpake of the poore; nor
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21818:49"/>
that they ever eſtabliſhed any good pollicie to help them. Yet notwithſtanding this agreeth

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> well with naturall reaſon, To do wel to his like. And this ſo noble a ſentence which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> caried for his poëſie or deviſe: What thou wouldeſt not ſhould <note place="margin">Lampri. in Alex.</note> be done unto thee, do it not to another, agreeth well with the common ſence, and ſeemes well to be a principle of nature, not only in the negative, Not to doe, but alſo in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, To doe to another, as we would he ſhould doe unto us. Yet although naturall light leade us hereunto, the Paynims have not yet come to this point. The hyſtoriagrapher <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius</hi> ſayth: That the Emperour <hi>Alexander</hi> learned this excellent device of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or of the Iewes in his time. Therefore it appeareth by the aboveſaid reaſons, That the doctrine of manners, which is taught us by the Chriſtian Religion, is much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than that which the Religions of the Paynims and Philoſophers teach, ſeeing they

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> make no account of the poore which are recommended unto us by ſo many precepts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Moreover, the Chriſtian Religion abateth the pride of mens hearts, and ſo makes them know they are ſinners: and the religion of Paynims and Philoſophers fill men with pride &amp; preſumption, perſuading them, That naturally they are vertuous of themſelves, and inclinable to do good and vertuous works, which they attribute to their owne vertue, and not to God. Yet more, the Chriſtian Religion teacheth us to be patient, to ſupport the imperfections one of another, and to pardon: but contrary, that of the Paynims and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers perſuadeth to ſeek vengeance. For a concluſion, none can deny, but that the doctrin of Chriſtian Religion is in all points more excellent and perfect than that of the Paynim Religion. But when I ſpeake of the Paynim Religion, I underſtand all other Religions (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> it be the Iewiſh Religion, out of which the Chriſtian taketh his originall) for I hold for Paynims the Turkes, Sarracens, and all other barbarous people, which allow neither the old nor new Testament, and that have no knowledge in them.</p>
               <p>But I doe not doubt but ſome will here make a queſtion in this time wherein wee are, <note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Reformed are all one.</note> that is, What Religion ought to be accounted Chriſtian, whether the Catholicke or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Hereunto I anſwere: That we ought not to make two of them, and that it is but one ſame Religion, and as the names Catholicke, and Evangelicke, and Reformed, are all one name; ſo is the thing it ſelfe: for the one and the other acknowledgeth Chriſt, which is the foundation; and hold the articles of the faith of the Apoſtles Symbole; approve the Trinitie, and the Sacraments of Baptiſme, and the holy Supper: although there be ſome

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> diverſitie in the intelligence of certain points, we may not for that make them, two divers Religions. For in breefe, the one and the other is Chriſtian, ſeeing they take Chriſt for the foundation. But for this purpoſe I will here recite a diſcourſe of a learned man (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) which I lately heard at my lodging in my iourney from Paris to Baſle. By which diſcourſe, this good perſon (although he was Evangelike) maintained, That the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and Evangelikes do agree, not only in name, but alſo in doctrin, although Sophiſters will perſuade the contrary. This propoſition at the firſt ſeemed unto me a very Paradox: but when I heard and underſtood the reaſons of that good man, his ſaying ſeemed very true unto me. There was in the companie a gentleman Catholike, none of theſe great tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and bablers, but a man very gentle and affable, who tooke great pleaſure to heare this

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> diſcourſe, &amp; asked many queſtions of this good man, whom I cannot name, for I never ſaw him before. He was no man of great ſhew, neither was there any great eſtimation made of him at the beginning, before we heard him ſpeake: but at the end of our Table, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we had given thanks (upon certain talke we had of Religion) he put forth the ſaid propoſition. All the company prayed him to cleare and illuminate that point, and to ſpeake his full opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therein; for there was neither Catholike nor Evangelike, which deſired not greatly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21818:49"/>
to underſtand that point. He begun then in this manner (after he had prayed all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to take in good part what he ſhould ſay, and humanely to excuſe his faults, if any eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.) <q>Maſters (ſaith he) I ſee well, that all this company caſteth their eies upon me, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to heare of me the proofe of the propoſition which I uttered. To ſatisfie then your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, although I have not premeditated all the reaſons which might be ſpoken to maintain that I ſay: yet I will alledge ſome, which I hope you will not iudge impertinent. I will then here repeat my propoſition, that is, That the Catholikes hold the ſame points of Christian Religion that we of the Reformed or Evangelike do. True it is, that the ſophiſters wil needs perſuade the Catholikes, that we hold another doctrine than they doe, eſpecially touching the Sacrament of the Altar, or the Supper (for all is one) and touching good works and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other points: and in veritie, the doctrine of our Religion differeth farre from that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the Sophisters, yea in principall points, as is ſeene by the conference of our confeſsion of Faith, with their articles. But I ſay and will maintaine, That the moſt part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes underſtand not the articles of the Sophiſters; neither can they comprehend them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conſiſt in certaine ſubtile diſtinctions, and ſophiſticall tearmes. The ſchoole doctors knowing that their doctrine cannot be comprehended by the ſimple ſence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon iudgement of men, make the people beleeve, that it makes no matter though they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing, if ſo be they beleeve generally, that the articles of their faith bee true. And this they cal an implicit, wrapped, or entangled faith, that is to ſay, it is ſo covert and hid, that the people underſtand nothing. But I meane not to ſpeake of the Sophists doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but of ſuch points of Religion, whereof the Catholikes have ſome knowledge by the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> apprehenſion of ſence and common iudgement. For I maintaine, &amp; it is true, That in theſe points, or in the moſt part, and eſpecially in the cheefe things they agree with us, although the Sophiſters make them beleeve the contrary. And by the way to make it appeare, let us a little diſcourſe upon the principall articles of our Christian Religion (as of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of Iustification, of Workes, and certaine other points) and we ſhall ſee plainely, that the Catholikes agree with us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, if you aske of a good Catholike, if when he receives the Sacrament on Eaſter day, he cruſheth and bruſeth with his teeth the very fleſh and bones of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: he will anſwere you, hee beleeves it not, and that hee detesteth and abhorreth that talke of cruſhing and bruſing with the teeth, the fleſh and bones of our Savior. If you demand

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of him, if he do not beleeve, that when he receiveth the Sacrament, he receiveth ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the body and bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: he will anſwer: yea, that he beleeves ſo. If you yet aske him, if when he receives the ſacrament of the Hoſt he beleeve that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and drinketh by the ſame meanes, the ſacrament of the blood by Concomitance, and that the cup which is given him to drinke in, is not but for him to rince his mouth withal: he will ſay he beleeves not this, and that eating is not drinking, and that hee knoweth not what that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>comitance is: &amp; that he beleeveth, that receiving the Hoſt, he eateth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the body, and that drinking on the cup, he drinketh the Sacrament of the blood. If you demand of him, if he beleeve not, that in the holy ſacrament there is made a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he wil anſwer you, that he beleeves it not, becauſe he knows not what Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is, nor what they meane by that long and prodigious word, &amp; that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it is ſome obſcure word invented by the Sophisters, to hide from ſimple people holy things, and to darken cleare things. And truly it is a ſtrange thing, and abhorring from common ſence and from all humanitie and Chriſtianitie, to bruſe and burſt the humane fleſh &amp; bones of our Savior Chriſt betwixt our teeth.

                  <q>And how ſhould Catholikes beleeve this Canon, ſeeing the prieſts themſelves beleeve it not? I prove it. For if they beleeved it, they would never ſay maſſe upon fridaies, nor in

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Lent, or other ſaſting dayes: and the Charterhouſe, Celeſtines nor Enſumine Friers and Monks would ſay no maſſes, for feare to eat ſleſh. O, but will one ſay, This is a ſtrange rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: I confeſſe it; but the aforeſaid Cannon is as ſtrange: and how ſtrange ſoever, yet can it not be overthrowne, without giving ſome ſpirituall interpretation unto the manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament. But ſtraight as ſoone as a man comes there, behold we are at an agreement. You ſee then how the Catholikes, yea, the prieſts themſelves beleeve not in that Canon, which notwithſtanding is the only foundation of the maſſe. Yea, but you will ſay, The Catholikes go to maſse and find it good. I confeſse it, but it is upon cuſtome they go thither, not becauſe they underſtand or beleeve any other thing touching the Sacrament, than that we have already ſaid. And therefore ſeeing they do agree with us in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> there ſhall be no great danger nor loſse for them to ſend away and baniſh into the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopian Iſlands or into <hi>Poliphaemus</hi> den their maſſe, yea, though but for a time to ſee and prove, whether they might well and commodiouſly ſpare it or no. As wee read Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the ſixt did, who exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated all the people of the country of Flanders, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rebellion that they had made againſt the king of France their ſoveraigne; who alſo interdicted all the prieſts of the countrey upon paine of eternall damnation, to ſay no maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor to adminiſter any Sacraments to the Flemmings, til they had obtained abſolution of his fatherhood. The poore Flemmings ſeeing themſelves without maſſes (for in no ſort their prieſts would ſay any) they writ to the king of England, making unto him great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. The king of England ſent them word not to be diſmayed nor troubled for want of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> maſses, for he would ſend them prieſts out of his country, to ſay them maſſes ynough. But the prieſts of England went not, fearing to be comprehended in that fulmination of the Pope. In the meane while the Flemmings attending whileſt the king of England ſent the prieſts, accuſtomed ſo much themſelves to be without maſſes, being merry and making good cheare, that they were well, and no more it troubled them. Many other countries alſo at this day which have no maſſes, paſſe the time well ynough to their content, as England,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21818:50"/>
Scotland, and Denmarke, &amp; the moſt part of Almaign. I beleeve alſo, if men did aſſay it in

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> France, to obtaine peace and union, they would not find it ſo evill as they thinke. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready we agree upon the Sacrament, as is aboveſaid: we hold alſo the Epiſtles, Goſpels, &amp; the leſsons which are taken out of the Pſalmes of <hi>David,</hi> and the Prophets: for we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes find that in our Bible; yea, farre more faithfully enregiſtred than in the Miſsall: all the remainder is not worth the holding. For as for their maſsing garments, men of good iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t know wel, That apparell addes no holineſse to the maſſe; ſeeing alſo that French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men naturally ſtaie not long in one faſhion of apparrell, but eaſily chaunge from one to another. I confeſſe in regard of the common people, which only ſtay upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſee, that they will take no great luſt in a maſse, without the maſse garments: as if the Curate ſaid it, in his doublet and hoſe without more, or in his ierkin, it is certaine; that commonly the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pariſhioners would greatly ſcandilize it, and would not find it good. And yet a true thing it is, that apparell makes not the maſſe better, neither have they any ſanctitie in them to deſerve to be retained. For if it were true, that ſuch garments made the maſſe better, and added any holineſse unto it; then would it follow, that the better the garments and habites are, ſo much the better ſhould the maſſes be; &amp; then would there be found great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the bountie and goodneſſe of maſſes; and ſo would it follow, that the maſſes of rich men ſhould be better than poore mens, a thing very abſurd and odious: that were alſo to make village maſſes of no account, becauſe their maſſe garments are often tattered and rent. So that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we muſt come to this reſolution, to ſhun theſe abſurdities; That garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts bring no holineſſe to the maſſe; and that in retaining the holy Sacrament, the Goſpell, the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Epiſtles, and the leſsons of the Pſalmes and Prophets, which are in the maſse, there would be found no danger to let go all the reſt. Now then if we lay by through all France the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous things of the maſse, are not all the reſt of the exerciſes of religion alike? The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes go to the church to pray unto God; ſo doe we alſo. They goe to heare ſermons of the word of God; ſo do we alſo. They go thither to praiſe God in ſinging of the Pſalms of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> and we alſo. They go thither to keepe their Eaſter; and we alſo. For it is all one to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Eaſter and the Supper. Breefly, all our exerciſes of Religion are alike. I know well you will ſay there is a difference, becauſe the Catholikes pray and ſing pſalms in Latin; and we in French. But I anſwere you, that that is nothing, ſo that men underſtand what they ſay. For God underſtandeth well all languages. You will ſay unto me alſo, that the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> preachers of the one and of the other preach not the ſame doctrine. Yet I anſwere, that though it be ſo, yet do we agree in all the principall points of Religion, which are neceſsary to be knowne for the ſalvation of our ſoules. If in any other points our preachers cannot agree, we muſt let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agree amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, and content our ſelves to know the articles which are neceſſary for our ſalvation. For it cannot be ſaid, that if we cannot be as ſubtil and ſharpe as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of Aquin, <hi>Bonaventure, Scot, Bricot,</hi> or other like doctors of Theologie, that therefore we muſt needs be damned. It were a very ſtraunge thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that God would have his holy Religion ſo obſcure, that none but Sophiſts ſhould think to underſtand any thing of it. But contrary, we muſt beleeve, That God hath given it unto us, ſimple, cleare, and intelligible, that even plaine people might comprehend and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> underſtand it. So if it pleaſe God, we need not leave to be ſaved, although wee know not what meaneth Tranſubſtantiation, Concomitance, and ſuch like tearmes, which are not read in the Bible; and although we be not ſo ſharpe and quicke to underſtand the nature of quiddities, the ſubſistence of Accidens ſeperated from the ſubiect, the effects and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſecond intentions, the motion of the Chimaere in Vacuitie, and other like deepe ſubtilties of ſpeculative Theologie. But I have above ſhewed, that the Catholikes and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21818:51"/>
we do well accord in the Sacrament of the Altar, or the Supper; ſo do we in the principall

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> points of Christian Religion. Demand of a Catholick, if he do not beleeve, That he ſhall be ſaved by the merite of the death &amp; paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; he will ſay, yea, that he beleeveth it. Aske yet of him, if he do not beleeve, That one onely drop of the precious blood of our Savior, the eternall ſonne of God, is ſufficient to ſave all the world; hee will ſay, yea. Make upon it this conſequence, That it followeth then, that the death and paſsion of Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhed all his blood for us, is more than ſufficient for our ſalvation; hee will not deny this. Aske him after, if he beleeve, that for our ſalvation there muſt be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the blood of martyrs, ſupererogatorie works, merits of Saints, &amp; good works, with the blood of Chriſt, the ſonne of God; he will anſwere you, That hee beleeves not, that there muſt be ſuch a mingle mangle, ſince the blood of the ſonne of God is ſufficient for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that, that ſhould be to pollute it, and that he knowes not what ſupererogatorie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> workes are. And touching good workes, which they ſay we reiect: aske of the least child, which learnes his Catechiſme, if a Chriſtian ought not to do good workes, to ſhew himſelfe a Christian; he will anſwere you, yea. Demand of him alſo, if good workes bee not meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious towards God; he will anſwere you, That they ſo pleaſe God, that (in regard of them as by merit) an infinit ſort of good things are given us, as health, long life, children, and other graces, except eternall life, which he gives us by the only merit of Ieſus Chriſt. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there is no Catholike in the world which will ſay more of good workes than this. As for faith in generall, we receive both the one and the other, the holy Scripture of the old and new Teſtament. Touching Baptiſme, we agree in the ſubstance, namely, that it ought

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to be done, In the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy ghoſt, and with the ſigne of the water. We differ about ſpittle, ſalt, and the coniurations of devils, which the Catholike prieſts do ſay to be within the body of little children, and they chaſe them out: wee indeed caſt off all this, as mens inventions, which would be wiſer than God, who preſcribeth them what they ſhall doe therein. And I aſſure my ſelfe; that the moſt part of the Catholikes would willingly, that thoſe things were reiected; and that prieſts would not ſpit in the mouths of their little children; and that they had no ſalt at all; neither doe they beleeve there are divels within the bodies of their little children. We alſo differ in certaine other ceremonies, which I will not diſcover now at length. But muſt wee hereupon ſay, that the Catholikes and we, are of two divers religions? The Friers and Iacobins, and many other

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſorts of Monkes in Chriſtendome, have all different ceremonies, in habits, in rules, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſervices and in all the exerciſes of their orders, yet they are all held to be of the Christian Religion. Moreover, though there were ſome difference betwixt us touching doctrine (ſeeing we accord in the principall points of Christian Religion) muſt there be accounted a pluralitie and diverſitie of Religion amongst us, for the Canon <hi>Ego Beren garius?</hi> Muſt men make all that ſtir, to rore out all the Canons and artillerie of France, and thunder at all the townes and caſtles of the kingdome, to fill all places with armes, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors, and all the townes with the blood of Chriſtians, and to make red the rivers, for ſuch a quarel as this? Muſt brother arme himſelfe againſt his brother, the father against his ſonne? muſt needs the Nobilitie ruin at it ſelfe? muſt all the people be trodden under

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> feet, &amp; the whole realme be brought into a combuſtion. For verily, none makes war upon us, but becauſe we wil not beleeve in the aforeſaid Canon, and yet they which do this unto us, do not beleeve in it themſelves, as we have before ſhewed. But yet there is a point that ſeemeth to be one of the moſt principall points of Religion, wherein we differ, namely, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Pope, in whom we beleeve not. But I am of opinion, that the moſt part of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes beleeve in him no more than we; and that the matter is not of ſufficient weight to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21818:51"/>
make any great contention of. Our anceſtors in times paſt have wel paſsed their time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a Pope; and wherefore ſhould not we do ſo, as well as they. In the time of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, <hi>le bien ayme,</hi> there were two popes in Christendome, the one at Rome called pope <hi>Vrbane,</hi> and the other at Avignon, who was called <hi>Clement.</hi> The Christian princes and commonweales at this time knew not which was the better of them, yet ſome follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pope of Rome, and they were called Vrbanists; and others the Pope of Avignon, and they were called Clementines: and when that the pope died at Rome or in Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, men elected alwayes another in his place: ſo that it appeared, that this pluralitie of popes would ever endure. The king of France and his Counſell were occaſioned to exhort both of them to ſubmit themſelves to a Counſell, which might adviſe and ordaine, which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two ſhould be Pope, or if the one or the other ought not to be. The king could never

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> perſuade them to come to this accord; and eſpecially the pope of Avignon was more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than the other. Hereupon the king cauſed to aſſemble the vniverſitie of Paris, and eſpecially our masters of Sorbonne, to have their advice what he ſhould doe in this caſe. At that time was there a learned Doctor in Theologie in Sorbonne Colledge, who was called M. <hi>Iohn de Gigenconet,</hi> who maintained, That the Catholike church might wel for a time be without a Pope, yea, for ever; &amp; alledged many good reaſons, which for times ſake I will not here recite. Breefly, the Vniverſitie was congregated, and thereby it was reſolved, that the king ought to withdraw himſelfe and all his kingdome from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of both the Popes, untill there were another legitimately elected. And that there were good means to be diſpatched of the pope, viz. to leave the collations of benefices to the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ordinary Collators, and alſo to labour unto the prelates of Fraunce, for diſpenſations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit. Hereupon the king made an Edict, with the advice of his daughter the Vniverſitie, (ſo names he it) whereby inhibitions &amp; defences were made to all ſubiects, as well of the Nobilitie and the Clergie, as of the third Eſtate, no more to acknowledge either of the ſaid Popes, for Popes, neither any more to run either to Rome or Avignon, for the obtaining and impetration of benefices, diſpenſations, or other buls and proviſions Apostolicall; but to the ordinary Collators, and to the Prelates of the French church, upon paine to be debarred of their pretended right, and other great puniſhments: which Edict was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ſpace of three yeares: at the end of which time was a Pope choſen at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Piſe, called <hi>Alexander</hi> the fift, under whoſe obedience the king and his kingdome

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yeelded themſelves. But the ſpace of the ſaid three yeares they did well ynough without a Pope in France: and ſo likewiſe during the ſaid time of pluralitie of Popes, which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forty yeares. And there were then many princes, which acknowledged neither the one nor the other for Popes; as the king of Aragon, the countie of Hainaut, the duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne, the commonwealth of Liege. If then in times paſt ſo many could be without popes, why might we not as wel ſpare them now as then? But as I have ſaid before, I ſee not why the Catholikes ſhould ſo much care for the Pope, as to travell and iourny ſo farre as Rome to kiſse his pantophle, nor to ſpend ſo much money to buy his pardons, being ſuch vile and baſe marchandize. To conclude (my maſters) it ſeemeth unto me by this breefe diſcourſe, I have made hitherto, that my propoſition is ſufficiently cleared: That the Catholike and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we differ not in Religion, but do agree in all points neceſſary for our ſalvation.</q> After that, that good parſon had made us the ſaid diſcourſe, truly every one of us thanked him, but eſpecially the Catholike gentleman, ſaying: That as for him he never beleeved otherwiſe <note place="margin">A pleaſant diſcourſe of Friers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</note> the points which he had delivered, but even as hee had ſaid: and that he would never have thought, that they of the Evangelike Religion had accorded ſo well with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, as he ſaw they did. <q>But ſaid he (my maſters) after ſo ſerious a diſcourſe, it ſhould not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21818:52"/>
be impertinent to adde another, to make us laugh. All the companie prayed him to do it:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> then begun he to ſay in this manner: I have above touched, how habites and apparrell brought no ſanctitie to the maſſe: we may alſo ſay, That they adde no ſanctitie to the perſons, neither according to that common proverbe, Apparell makes not a Monke. Yet I find, that this question hath been ſometimes handled with great contention and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of opinions, which endured nigh fiftie yeares amongst the Friers, becauſe they could not accord upon the colour, greatneſſe, wideneſſe, and forme of their habites. For you muſt understand, that the glorious S. <hi>Francis,</hi> amongst other articles of his rule, hee had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one, whereby he ordained, That all that were of his Order, for apparrell, ſhould cloth themſelves with the baſest, vilest, and of the lowest price that could be; that they ſhould onely have one coat with an hood, and another without an hood; and that they ſhould

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> weare no ſhoes, nor ride on horſebacke. Vpon the intelligence and interpretation of this article, aroſe great and marvellous altercations and diſputations in the order of Friers: inſomuch, that they held a generall Chapiter, to accord theſe diſputations, and to rule themſelves all by one ſort of habites. For ſome wore habites of one colour, ſome of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome ſhort, others long; inſomuch, that they ſeemed not to be of the ſame Order. In this Chapiter then was there a great diſputation, about the intelligence and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſaid article. About the last two points they were eaſie to agree: for ſeeing they were forbidden by the ſaid article to ride on horſebacke, they reſolved to ride but on Aſſes and Mules, or on foot, as commonly they do. They conſidered alſo, That Aſſes were fittest for them in their Covents, for being kept with leaſt charge. As for ſhooes,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> they reſolved, That they would take away the most part of the leather, leaving onely a ſole, with a thong, to go overthwart the foot, to make the ſole fast to the foot, &amp; ſo ſhould they not be ſhoes, but ſoles. But the greatest difficultie and strife was about the faſhion of the hood, and of the coat or Iacket. For in the ſaid Chapiter were mooved three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall questions, by certaine ſubtile and cunning Friers. The first, upon the Colour: the ſecond, upon the Quantitie: and the third, about the Forme. But to handle theſe three questions in order, you must understand, That about the colour there was divers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon which they could not accord. For the bleſſed S. <hi>Francis</hi> had ſpoken nothing of the colour in his rule: but only ordained, That they of his order ſhould weare habites of a low price. Then fell out a great question: What colour was of least price, and thought to be

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> most vile. Some reaſoned, That the greene colour was the vileſt, and might bee bought cheaper than any other: and that it was ordinarily ſeene, that people of most vile conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as carters, marriners, and other meane people) did weare that colour, in lining to their doublets, as the worst colour of all. They ſaid alſo, That the matter wherewith a greene colour is made, is cheaper than any other: for with hearbes and leaves, greene may bee made, to die both woollen and linnen. Others ſaid, the murrey or ſmoakie colour was the worſt &amp; beſt cheap: for to make that colour, there need no more, but to take white wooll and ſoot. But the third opinion ſeemed to be beſt taken with reaſon and equitie. And that was they which ſaid, That there was no viler colour nor more meet for their Order, than that which came from the beaſts back it ſelfe. But it is ſo, that both white and black came from

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the beaſts backe: and it is evident, that the bleſſed S. <hi>Francis</hi> did ſo underſtand it, they ſhould weare the colour of the beaſt in token of humilitie &amp; patience; ſaying further: That all other colours coſt ſomething, &amp; if it were but labour; but the colour of the beaſt coſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Therfore they concluded, That al the order of Friers ought to weare their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts either of white or blacke colour, and not of greene, ſmokie, or any other colours, &amp; that this was their opinion. Aſsuredly theſe reaſons of the firſt diſputers were ſo pregnant, that they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21818:52"/>
ſhaked al the reſt of the company: yet notwithſtanding they which had diſputed for Green,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and ſmokie colours, thinking it not good to bee overcome at the first blow, replied more. They which have diſputed of the colour of the beaſt (ſay they) do ſhew, that they hold ſome thing of the beaſt (ſpeaking under the brotherly correction of their ſuperiours, and the Chapiter) for that their concluſion is alternative and indeterminative. For they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon white and blacke, without reſolving either upon the one or the other; and that ſuch a concluſion implied evident contradiction. For (ſay they) there is nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary than white and blacke. Moreover, they ſaid, That if ſo be the colours of the ſheepe ſhould he worne of them, men would iudge it to be a token of their pride &amp; preſumption, which is the greateſt of all mortall ſinnes, becauſe for pride <hi>Lucifer</hi> fell from heaven into hell: for the world may ſay of them, that they cover themſelves with the colour of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſheepe, and notwithſtanding are ravening wolves: ſeeing it is written, That men must take heed of them, that make an outward countenance to be ſheepe, and yet are woolves, and by that ſimilitude are they noted to be falſe prophets. They ſhewed alſo, that alreadie other orders of beggers or Mendicants have taken poſſeſsion of thoſe two colours, blacke and white. For the Iacobins wore white under, and black above. And the Carmelites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, blacke under, and white above: and generally, all ſorts of other monkes, which held the rules of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and bleſsed S. <hi>Benet,</hi> and others were all monks, either white, or blacke. And that it ſhould not be well done to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them their colours, or to enterpriſe upon them: for ſo they might oppoſe themſelves againſt them, and that, that was not the way to draw unto them the devotion of the world. Finally, they ſhewed,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that if their order of Friers tooke blacke, there are ſome countries where there are no blacke ſheepe, or very few, as in Berry, Limoges, and Languedoc; then in theſe countries muſt they be forced to die their wooll, ſo would it become deare, and then directly ſhould they do againſt the rule of bleſſed S. <hi>Francis,</hi> That bids them weare clothes of the vileſt and cheapeſt price; this ſhould alſo be to goe againſt their liberties and priviledges, To pay the leaſt they can: for by their rule they are forbidden to handle any ſilver. And by the contrary, if the Order chuſe a white colour, there are other countries, where there are no white ſheepe, or few: as in Tuſcane, and many other places, ſo that the Friers there muſt have their white clothes out of farre countries, which will be to their great coſt, &amp; ſo will be directly againſt the ſaid rule, and their liberties. And therefore theſe diſputers perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſtill in their firſt opinion for greene and ſmokie colours. The others which had reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the colour of the beaſt, finding themſelves pinched and pricked, replied, That that opinion of greene and ſmokie colour was the moſt ſavage opinion of the world, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reaſon they had which maintained it. For (ſaid they) greene is a colour fit for fooles. Moreover, in countries, where they ſay there is nothing but cole-blacke woll, how can they die that blacke, greene, or ſmokie? Finally, their diſputation became ſo hot, that it was greatly to be feared they would have falne to fiſts, if certaine auncient fathers ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in higheſt places, had not impoſed ſilence to the brethren, &amp; made them underſtand, That truly they had well and learnedly debated the matter both of the one part and of the other, and that they thought that the queſtion was waightie, high and hard, and ſuch as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> merited the advice and reſolution of the holy father the Pope, and that therefore they would reſerve unto him the determination thereof. As ſoone as the Friers heard ſpeake of the Pope, each one held his peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this, the ſenior Fathers cauſed to propoſe the ſecond queſtion of the three, for which the Chapiter was aſsembled, touching the quantitie of habits, that is, if they ſhould be long, or ſhort, wide, or ſtrait. The firſt diſputers (in great number) were all of advice,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21818:53"/>
That their garments of Order ought to be ſhort and ſtrait for many good reaſons, which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> they alleaged: For, ſaid they, habits ſhort and ſtrait, are more vile and better cheape than long and large, becauſe they have not ſo much ſtuffe in them. Therefore ſince the glorious ſaint <hi>Frauncis</hi> our founder, would and ordained that we ſhould weare habits of vile and little price, we can not better obſerve that holy rule (wherein conſisteth the eſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) than in making our habits as short and as ſtrait as is poſsible. Moreover (ſayd they) our father and good founder S. <hi>Francis,</hi> hath he not appointed we ſhould be Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants, and livers upon the almes of good people? therefore we must make account to gather our almes to live, and to ſeeke it ſometimes far off, upon paine to endure hunger and want; for we ſhall have little brought into our covent: then must wee trot hither and thither at all times, raine it or haile it, bee it hot, cold, drie, or wet, yea in Lent &amp; Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to preach, but no kind of habits is more meet to overthwart the fields, than ſuch as are ſhort, for the long are unfit. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, ſuch as reaſoned after, ſaid, That the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was ſtrange and ridiculous; becauſe, if Friers ſhould weare ſhort habits, they would ſeeme more liker Millers than Friers: and it is ordinarily ſeene, that in thoſe countries where Friers uſe ſhort habits, the Order was much deſpiſed &amp; mocked of the world, and men called them curtall Friers: and therefore long and large were moſt covenable and fit for them; &amp; that (the bleſſed ſaint <hi>Francis</hi> rightly underſtood) they ſhould weare long habits: for in the ſaid article hee uſeth the word <hi>Tunike,</hi> which ſignifieth a long robe or garment. Moreover, long habits are more ſeemely for religious men, and short garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for lay men: and that a long garment makes Religious men the most reverenced and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in the world. They ſaid further, that all other other ſorts of Monks wore long and wide habits, and it ſhould be a great noveltie, if the Order of the glorious S. <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould take a ſhort habit. Likewiſe (ſaid they) when wee go into the pulpit to preach, or when we go to ſay Maſſe, ô it is a goodly ſight to have our garments like Millers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they concluded, That their habits ſhould be long and large. But the firſt reaſoners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this, ſaieng to the firſt point, That the good ſaint <hi>Francis</hi> had taught them the way of humilitie, and that therefore they ought not to ſeeke to weare long garments, to be therefore honoured and reverenced of the world; for that taſted of pride, and not of his humilitie: and that they which are mocked and deſpiſed of the world, are eſteemed of God; becauſe the wiſedome of the world is follie before God: and ſo contrarie. As for the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſecond point, they ſaid, That this word <hi>Tunike</hi> in S. <hi>Benet</hi> his rule, ſignifieth not a long robe, but a little cloke or caſſocke; and ſo is it found in frier <hi>Ambroſe Calepin</hi> his dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onarie (who was of our Order) not a long robe, but <hi>Toga;</hi> and that therefore the rule makes for them in that point. So is it beſt that Friers weare ſhort habits, as little clokes, and caſſoks, or jerkins. And as for their obiection, That other Monks do weare long and wide garments; ſo much the better ſaid they, and the rather ſhould wee weare ſhort and ſtrait, that there may be a diſtinction betwixt us and others. As for their reaſon, That to weare ſhort and ſtrait garments, would make us like lay men: wee anſwer to that (ſay they) That the hood wil make a difference betwixt us and lay men; for the length of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can not diſtinguiſh us from lay people, for they alſo weare long robes, as Proctors,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Advocats, Counſellors, Huiſhers, Phiſitions, yea even Merchants in their ſhops. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe (ſayd they) that at the beginning it wil be a noveltie to ſee us weare garments ſhort and ſtrait with an hood, but time and cuſtome will take away the ſtrangeneſſe thereof, for in all things there is a beginning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The chiefe and antient fathers, rulers of this diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing their friers (who came in place to accord) to enter and grow further into contention and contrarietie of opinions,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21818:53"/>
impoſed them ſilence as they had done before upon the first question, and ſayd unto them,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> That they would remit to the holy Father, the deciſion &amp; reſolution of this high &amp; hard question, touching the largeneſſe and length of habits: but yet they must adviſe, if at the least in this Chapter we may reſolve upon the third question, touching the forme and faſhion of theſe habits.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>So they began to demand voices, for to know whether their habits ought to bee ſingle or double; if it be lawfull to have ſome fine and goodly faſhion on them, or not; if they ſhould have collars, or none; or skirts, or none; or ſleeves, or no ſleeves; or if ſleeves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hanging ſleeves; if there must be an hood, whether it were not best to be pointed &amp; ſharpe, as the Carthuſian Friers have, or round, as they of other Religions have. Vpon all thoſe points there was great diſputation, and all matters were well and ſubtilly diſputed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of in this Chapter. It ſeemed to ſome, that it were not best to have hanging ſleeves, for they were not comely, but rather wide and open ſleeves, that they might ſerve for a ſcrip or pouch. For (ſaid they) ſince our good father S. <hi>Francis</hi> hath commaunded us to beg and live of almes; and that by an article of his holy rule, he hath forbidden us to carry with us, poke, bag, or ſcrip; as alſo is forbidden us in the Goſpell, it followeth well, that hee wold have us to underſtand, that we ſhould have great &amp; wide ſleeves for to put our alms in. To this ſome anſwered, That wide ſleeves were dearer than ſtrait; for that they had more matter and ſtuffe in them, and therfore ſuch ſleeves are contrary to their rule. And as for the difficultie found out upon the forbidding of bags and ſcrips, and of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience that might follow thereof, for want of ſomething to put in their almes: they

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſaid, for this there were an help, viz. to take a man with them (which we may cal a Iudas) who may carry a bag or ſcrip for that uſe, yea, he may take ſilver, if any will give it us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Yet were there made many other great arguments and ſubtill allegations upon this question of the faſhion of habites: and ſome thought it beſt, That that faſhion of hoods which the Charter houſe Friers uſed, to be well, &amp; best to be imitated. For that that ſharp point above might allegorically ſignifie, that they had ſharpe and quicke ſpirits; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a fame and reputation to be ſo, their ſermons would be more accounted of. But the good Fathers conſidering, That nothing could bee reſolved in that Chapter; and that it was as expedient to ſend to Rome for three questions, as for two; they made the companie privie to their advice, namely, That it were best to ſend to Rome, to have the holy fathers

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> opinion and counſell upon theſe three questions; and that ſome of them preſent ſhould goe for that purpoſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Certaine time after, delegates of their Order tooke their iourney to Rome, unto Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the third of that name, who raigned in the yeare 1280, which made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all the ſaid diſputation, &amp; the great diſorder that was in their Order about the ſaid three points. The Pope &amp; his Cardinals were as much troubled to reſolve thoſe high and ſubtile questions, as the ſaid Friers had been in their Chapter. Yet the Pope by the advice of the ſaid Cardinals, made them upon this matter this reſolution, That he ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and commaunded, that upon all thoſe questions, that ſhould be ſtraitly kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which ſhould be concluded and determined in a Chapiter generall, or els in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Chapiters, which to thoſe ends ſhould afterwards be convocated and aſſembled: upon condition notwithſtanding, that alwayes there might bee ſeene ſhine in the Friers, and in their workes, an holy povertie, according to their holy rule. But this was to make them fall into a farre greater contention and diſputation, than ever: ſo as alſo in their Chapiters which they held afterward, they could never accord, following that ordinance of the Pope; but reſolved yet again to return to the Pope, which they did, but it was about
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21818:54"/>
one and thirtie yeares after the former time, during which time they held many Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to handle that matter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Comming then to no end in their Chapiters, they again ſent delegates to Rome, to pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, who then held the Counſell at Vienna, <hi>anno Dom.</hi> 1311; who gave him to understand, How according to the ordinance of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> his predeceſsour, they had done all that which poſsible they could, to overcome the aforeſaid difficulties; which at length they recited unto him, but they could not accord upon any reſolution. But contrarie, that as they diſputed, there aroſe alwayes new difficulties and doubts in the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſpirits, and that therefore they came to him, as to a very oracle of truth, who could and knew how to reſolve all thoſe doubts, and many others. The Pope having heard them, put the matter unto the determination of the Cardinals, Prelates, Doctors, and others aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in that Counſell; you muſt thinke, that this whole Counſell was greatly troubled, as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> before Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> and his Cardinals had been. Yet that the ſaid Friers might not go away as they came, without having anſwere from the Popes Oracle: there was delivered unto them indeed, a true Oracle, that is to ſay, an ambiguous and obſcure anſwer, whereby the Pope by che advice of the ſaid Counſell, commanded the gardiens &amp; other cheefe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of that Order, to iudge of the vilitie, colour, length, wideneſse, and faſhion of their ſaid Order: the conſciences of which commiſsaries and gardians he burdened; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Friers, That they ſhould obey what their ſaid gardians and ministers ſhould reſolve, without ſeeking out ſo many ſcruples and doubts, and without deſire to know more than needed, by inventing ſo many ſubtilties. Theſe delegates returned home

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> with a faire Bull, yet was it not poſsible by any vertue thereof, to ſet down a rule in habits. For alwayes the Friers found to ſpeake against the advice and reſolutions of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, ſaying, They understood nothing, and that they had not read the text of the rule of bleſſed S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and that they were but beasts. In this contestation of Friers againſt their gardians and ſuperiours, remained their affaires by a long and great ſpace of yeares.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finally, in the yeare 1323, in the time of Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> the two and twentieth of that name, who held his ſeat in Avignon, the gardians and ſuperiors of that Order went to complain to his Fatherhood, ſhewing him, That they could not be obeyed, upon the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had made in vertue of the power which had been given them by the ſaid Bull of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Pope <hi>Clement.</hi> So they humbly prayed his ſaid Fatherhood, That he would vouchſafe to doe ſome good therein. The Pope to proceed in this matter more iuridically, or rather iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially would heare the partie; and therefore ſent to thoſe Friers which refuſed to obey their gardians and ſuperiors, That they ſhould either come and make their reaſons, or ſend the cauſe in writing, why they refuſed obedience. They ſent them. The aboveſaid Pope cauſed to aſſemble his Cardinals: and being in the Conclave, the allegations of the Friers pretended diſobedience, were read, and no doubt found ſo great and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo ſubtill and ſharpe, that a flie could not there have placed her foot, and indeed they could never give a reſolution thereof. True it is, that the Pope could doe no leſſe for his honour, than to ordaine ſomething. Therefore cauſed hee to expediate a Bull, wherein

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he exceedingly praiſeth the Buls of his predeceſſors, Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> and ſayth, That he marvelleth how men cannot be contented with the reſolution contained in them. After he makes declaration, That the vilitie of habits ſhould bee meaſured, according to the custome of every countrey. After that, he giveth commiſsion to the gardians and ſuperiors of every Order (as did Pope <hi>Clement)</hi> to make a rule for the longitude, latitude, thickneſſe, colour, faſhion, and vilitie, as well of the Tunikes,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21818:54"/>
as of the hood, and upon all other accidences, circumſtances, and dependances; willing and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> commanding them to obey the rule that ſhould bee made, without any more framing ſo many obiects, arguments, and fantaſticall contradicts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Behold in ſubstance the content of Pope <hi>Iohns</hi> Bull; whereby it appeareth, That neither hee nor all the Papall Conſistorie could ever give a law or a well determined reſolution upon the matter of the diſpute of Friers habits. I know not how ſince, they are accorded; but they have taken unto them the white and blacke colour, as it comes from off the beast, and of thoſe two intermingled colours they have made a third co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which, of them hath taken the name, and at this day are called Gray-friers. They have alſo choſen great ſide gownes and great hoods, as we ſee them weare at this day. Breefely, we ſee them accorded now of all their differences which they had touching the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> faſhion of their habits, except for the ſleeves. For there are yet Friers with great ſleeves, others with ſtrayt ſleeves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This is the diſcourſe touching the Friers contentions, and the three Decretals, made by three Popes, upon that matter, whereof the last is called an Extravagant, as in truth it is, and may well be called Extravagant, and the other two alſo: Praying you (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) to take in good part this hystorie; for I have not told it, to diſpleaſe any man; but to paſſe away the time whilest our horſes eat their provender; I beleeve it will be now ſoone time to leape on horſebacke, every man to draw to his way.</q> Vpon this, each man roſe up from the table, every one contented to heare this diſcourſe, which they never had heard before, as they all confeſſed. Then each man

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> tooke his count, payed, mounted on horſebacke, and went away. Now let us come to treat of <hi>Machiavell.</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for their owne profit? for after that by the meanes of their bankes, fermes, and other their dealings in the realme, they have gathered great heapes of money, they can at their pleaſure enhaunce the value thereof, both in their hands and out of their hands. Yet none complaines thereof. But in the end it will produce and bring forth ſome great diſorder and confuſion (as hath ſometimes been ſeen for like actions) for the reaſons well ynough knowne to wiſe people. As for peace, theſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21818:56"/>
people never like of (for they fiſh alwayes in a troubled water) gathering riches and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> heapes of the treaſures of the Realme, whileſt it is in trouble and confuſion. They alwayes have in their mouths their goodly Maximes of their <hi>Machiavell,</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach and hinder a good peace. A prince (ſay they) muſt cauſe himſelfe to bee feared, rather than loved: &amp; this muſt be held as a reſolved point. But if a peace be accorded to theſe rebels, ſuch as they deſire, then would it ſeeme that the king were afraid of his ſubjects, whereas he ſhould make himſelfe to be feared. True it is, that if ſuch a peace could be made with them, as it might againe procure another S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholmewes</hi> journey, nothing were ſo good &amp; pleaſant as that. For that is another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved point and Maxime, That a prince ought not to hold any faith or promiſe, but ſo farre, as concernes his profit: and that hee ought to know how to counterfeit the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> foxe, to catch and entrap other beaſts, and as ſoone as he hath them in his nets, to play the lion in ſlaying &amp; devouring them. We have ſet downe unto us that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly example of <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> who in our country could ſo well counterfeit the ſaid two beaſts. Behold here the language and dealings of our Machiaveliſtes, which at this day men call people of Service: for that there is no wickedneſſe in the world ſo ſtrange and deteſtable, but they wil enterpriſe, invent, and put it in execution, if they can. From whence comes it, that they be thus enclined to all wickedneſſe? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Atheiſts, contemners of God, neither beleeving there is a God which <note place="margin">Atheiſts en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cline to all wickednes, becauſe they feare not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of God.</note> ſeeth what they doe, nor that ought to puniſh them. It is that goodly doctrine of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> which amongſt other things complaines ſo much, that men cannot

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> be altogether wicked (as we ſhall touch in his place.) Theſe good diſciples (ſeeing that their maſter found this imperfection amongſt men, that they could not ſhew themſelves altogether and in all things wicked) doe ſeeke by all meanes to attaine a degree of perfect wickedneſſe. And indeed they have ſo well ſtudied and profited in their maſters ſchoole, and can ſo well practiſe his Maximes, that none can deny, but they are come unto the higheſt degree of wickedneſſe. What need men then to be abaſhed, if they ſee in the world, and eſpecially in this poore kingdome of France, ſuch famine, peſtilence, civile warres, the father to band againſt his ſonne, brother againſt his brother, they of the ſame Religion one againſt another, with all hatred, envie, diſloyaltie, treaſons, perfidies, conſpirations, empoyſonments, &amp; other great

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſinnes to raigne? Is there any marvaile if the people goe to wracke, the Cleargie be impoveriſhed, the Nobilitie almoſt extinct? For it is the firſt judgement and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, which he exerciſeth againſt us: becauſe ſome are filled with all impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Atheiſme, which they have learned of <hi>Machiavell:</hi> and others which ſhould reſiſt ſuch impieties, leaſt they ſhould take root, doe ſuffer them to encreaſe &amp; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that indeed all men are culpable of Atheiſme, impietie, of the deſpight of God and Religion, which at this day raigneth. Therefore moſt righteouſly dooth God puniſh us all.

Suppoſe therefore theſe ſimulations and hypocriſies come to be diſcovered in a prince, I pray you into what honour and reputation will hee fall? Shall he not be mocked, blamed, and deſpiſed of his ſubjects. If ſeeing himſelf diſcovered, hee make an open profeſſion of impietie and of Atheiſme (as wee ſee

Take an ante or a flie, and conſider the cauſes which makes theſe little creatures moove; you ſhall finde it is heat and moiſture, which are two qualities conſiſting in all living creatures, nouriſhers of nature: for aſſoone as heat &amp; moiſture faile in any living thing, it can no more live, nor moove, &amp; ſtraight is the body occupied with contrarie qualities, coldneſſe and drought, the enemies of nature. Mount and aſcend vp higher, and conſider what is the cauſe, that in the little bodie of an ante or flie, there are found the two qualities of heate and moiſture; you ſhall find, that it is becauſe all living creatures are compoſed of the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of fire, of aire, of water and of earth, in which, the ſaid foure qualities, of heat, moiſture, colde, and drineſſe do conſiſt; and whileſt heate and moiſture raigne in the

Conſider further what is the cauſe of the heate and the moiſture, and the other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which we ſee in the foure elements, and in the bodies made of them; you ſhall finde that the Sunne is cauſe of the heate, and the Moone cauſe of the moiſture, as ſence and experience ſhew it.

                  <p>Touching the doctrine of the Trinitie which we hold, it muſt bee confeſſed, that the philoſophers underſtood nothing thereof: and that by humane reaſon wee can not well be lead to the knowledge thereof: but this knowledge is manifeſted unto us by the witneſſes of God himſelfe, which are ſo cleare and evident in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as nothing can be more: but I have no purpoſe here to recite them; yet will I ſay: That the doctrine which I hold in this place; is not repugnant nor contrary unto <note place="margin">The d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For by their owne Maximes a very true thing it is, That God (who

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> is an eternall and infinit ſpirit) is not paſſible of any qualities or accidens: ſo that, that which is a qualitie in men, as bountie, love, wiſedome, an eſſence in God. This preſuppoſed, as a thing confeſſed of the philoſophers themſelves; it followeth, That, that infinit &amp; admirable wiſdome, wherby God knoweth himſelfe, is an eſſence, and not a qualitie in God: yea it is one &amp; the ſame eſſence, yet is it a diſtinct ſubſiſtence or hypoſtaſis, from him. For, the Wiſe, and Wiſedome, cannot be without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This Wiſdome then, is the ſecond perſon of the Trinitie; which the ſcripture calleth the Word, or the Sonne. Neither alſo is it repugnant to humane reaſon, to ſay, That theſe two perſons in one and the ſame eſſence, have an infinit and mutuall Intelligence together: which Intelligence proceedeth equally from two perſons, the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Father and the Sonne, as they are of equall eſſence, yet can not be confounded with them, although the ſaid Intelligence be the ſame eſſence: for <hi>Intelligens</hi> (underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) and <hi>Intelligentia</hi> (the underſtanding) ought to be diſtinguiſhed. This Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is the third perſon of the Trinitie, which the ſcripture calleth the holy Spirit. Behold then, how mans braine may ſomething comprehend by naturall reaſon, the doctrine which wee hold of the Trinitie, by a rude and groſſe deſcription, which is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21818:60"/>
like to that which the Geographers take to pourtray all the earth; namely, in five or

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſix groſſe lines, in a paper of an hand breadth. For the knowledge that our ſence can have of ſo high a thing, is farre leſſe in compariſon of the full truth thereof, than is ſuch a portrature of the Geographers in compariſon of all the earth: and therefore will I well confeſſe, that we neither need nor ought much to travaile, to diſpute by humane reaſon, of ſo high a thing, which of it ſelfe is infinit and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our ſences and underſtanding; and that they which doe leaſt diſpute with phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall reaſons, are moſt wiſe &amp; moſt modeſt; and that we ought wholie to hold and reſolve upon that which is written by &amp; in the holy Scripture. But having to do with Atheiſts, which receive not the witneſſes of the word of God, it hath made me ſhew in few words, That even by humane reaſon it ſelfe, they may be vanquiſhed by

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the truth of that doctrine which we hold. Let us now come to another point.</p>
                  <p>Naturall reaſon, and common ſence teacheth us, That there is one God, and that he is perfect in all perfection, for otherwiſe he could not be God: this is a point re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Hereof neceſſarily followeth it, That God is perfect juſt, and perfect merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Being perfectly juſt, by the rule of Iuſtice, he muſt needs condemne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all mankinde: for all men generallie are vicious, and vice meriteth condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but if God ſhould condemne and reject all mankind, it ſhould be repugnant to his mercie, which alſo ought to be perfect with effect. How then? ſhall we ſay, that God cannot be perfectlie juſt and mercifull together, becauſe it ſeemeth that his mercie repugneth his juſtice? God forbid that ſuch blaſphemie ſhould proceed out

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of our mouths. But we ſay: That thereby, naturall reaſon leads us to a Mediator, who being God and perfect, hath ſatisfied the Divine juſtice: which ſatiſfaction God the creator accepteth of mankind, becauſe the mediator is man alſo: and by the meanes of this great mediator God and man, which the creator hath given us, hee hath ſhewed himſelfe perfectlie juſt, in receiving of him a ſatiſfaction condigne to his juſtice, and perfectlie mercifull in pardoning us for his ſake: without which media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor we evidentlie ſee, that God cannot ſhew himſelfe perfectly juſt and mercifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that is to ſay, that he cannot ſhew himſelfe to be God, for the Father cannot be without the ſonne. It is then a true demonſtration drawne from moſt certaine and evident principles: There is one God, therefore he is perfect. If God be perfect (as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> no doubt he is) he is then perfectlie juſt and mercifull, but he cannot be both, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mediator God and man. <hi>Euclide</hi> nor <hi>Archimedes</hi> ever made more certainer demonſtrations.</p>
                  <p>But this mediator which the creator hath given to men, to make manifeſt his perfect juſtice &amp; perfect mercie, is his eternall Sonne, the wiſdome of the father; in favour of whom, as well before he came into the world, and had taken our nature, as ſince, men have enjoyed the mercie and clemencie of God, in employing that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to ſatiſfie the juſtice of God. This mediator was promiſed and eſtabliſhed to men from the beginning of the world, and ſince that, his promiſes have beene ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reiterated, that not only they have beene notoriovs to the particular people of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God, which followed the true Religion, but alſo to other people which follow falſe Religion. The Hiſtoriographer <hi>Suetonius</hi> (a Paynim, who never read any part of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture) ſpeaking of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> as though it were a vulgar and common thing, ſaith thus: Through all the Eaſt countries alwaies there hath beene a conſtant and auncient opinion, as a thing certaine, that it was ſo ordeined and foretolde of God, That from Iudea ſhould come the dominator and ruler of the world. <q>As much ſaith

the Hiſtorian <hi>Tacitus</hi> (a Paynim alſo that never ſaw holy letters) when he ſaid (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that he himſelfe was cunning, foretelling things to come, and in the knowledge of the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the other Prophets: for all the Prophets doe all clearlie ſay, That <hi>Meſsias</hi> ought to be borne of the race of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and of <hi>Dauid:</hi> yea eſpeciallie and plainly, the place it ſelfe where he ſhould be borne, that is to ſay, in Bethlem, a little towne of the tribe of Iuda. But <hi>Ioſephus</hi> knew well that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was neither of that race, nor borne in the towne of Bethlem: but wee muſt beleeve that <hi>Ioſephus</hi> underſtood better than he writ, and that falſlie he attributed that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Meſsias,</hi> to the emperour <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> upon a flattering humor, becauſe he had received ſo many great favours and benefits of him.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Chriſt and his Apoſtles had done in Iudea, and in places thereabout, but they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed them, attributing them to ſtrange gods, and to prophane men, and never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them as the very truth was. Of the ſame ſtampe is that which <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth, ſaying that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> healed one which was lame and impotent in his thigh; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sueton. in Veſp. cap,</hi> 7.</note> and a blind man alſo who had a revelation of <hi>Serapis,</hi> to go for his helpe to <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> That alſo which <hi>Spartianus</hi> writeth in the life of the emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> That a blind
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21818:61"/>
woman recovered her ſight in kiſſing his knees; and one blind-borne, recovered his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſight in onely touching him; and by that meanes <hi>Adrian</hi> loſt a feaver, which he then had. For we may eaſily ſee, that theſe were Chriſts miracles, or his Apoſtles, which the Paynims would faine ſteale from them, to and for their princes, as alſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the world, that there was no divinitie in them. For a reſolution then of this point, the promiſes of <hi>Meſsias</hi> have beene knowne through the world, as alſo his comming, even to the Paynims. For prophane authors do often make mention of Chriſt, even <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who ſayth, That Chriſt was put to death in the time of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tacit. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. lib.</hi> 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Tiberius,</hi> by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> his lieutenant in Iudaea. Behold then how the principall points of our Chriſtian Religion may be proved by humane reaſon and prophane authors, ſo great and reſplendent was, and is that light. For our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> herein may ſummarily be comprehended, <hi>To beleeve in God, and in him which he hath ſent, Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> If theſe Atheiſts then, will put out their owne eies, to the end they may not know God and the Chriſtian Religion, neither by holy Scriptures nor by humane reaſon, nor by the witneſſe of prophane authors, which ſpeake thereof, as of a thing divulged and notorious through all the world; we know not how to doe any other thing, but to leave them as deſperate perſons to welter in their ignorance, brutalitie and darkeneſſe, till God by his juſt judgement have ſunke them into the bottomeleſſe pit.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to our Maxime: We ſay, That to maintaine falſeneſſe in Religion, is to tread God and his Religion under their feet. Yet true it is, that the auncient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> have approved and maintained the falſeneſſe of Oracles, although it were not falſeneſſe invented by men, but very diabolicall illuſions, as ſhall be ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. True it is alſo, that they ſuſtained and allowed the bookes of the Sybils, and the augures, taken by the flight of birds, and ſuch other follies. But theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the want of knowledge of the true Religion, and for that they ſuffered themſelves to be guided by the Paynim Religion; which conſiſted in vaine ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and fooliſh lies. Yet notwithſtanding, whenſoever by good reaſon they could know, that any falſeneſſe had ſlided into their religion, they maintained it not, but tooke it away. An example hereof is this. The religion of <hi>Bacchus</hi> was firſt brought into Rome by a Grecian prieſt, who made ſacrifices and ceremonies in the night time, and at the beginning, women onely aſſiſted, and were preſent there, who after

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their ſacrifices banqueted together. The Romanes thinking no harme, ſuffered it for a time: but in ſucceſſion of time men alſo reſorted thither with women, pell mell, (as they ſay) and brought thither a new ceremonie; namely, to put out candles, and ring bels, to the end, none might heare ſuch as cried, when they were forced and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed. There was all villanie committed, not onely towards all ſort of women, but alſo towards young boyes. The Conſuls and Senat having diſcovered this, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded criminally againſt them which were found in ſuch aſſemblies, as guiltie of the raviſhments of women and of Sodometrie: and there were found culpable hereof more than ſeven thouſand, whereof the moſt part fled, and ſome ſlew themſelves, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were executed by juſtice; and an edict was made; Forbidding all ſacrifices from thenceforth to be made unto <hi>Bacchus.</hi> Even naturall reaſon, made thoſe poor Paynims, which were ignorant of Religion, to underſtand, that, that Religion could not be true, but is falſe and rejectable, which containeth in it any puniſhable crime. And if they could alſo have knowne the other falſities of their Religion, as well as this, I beleeve they would have cut them of, whatſoever <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſayth. But in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21818:62"/>
points of Religion, we may not any thing ſtay our ſelves upon that which the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Romans have done, or ſaid, unleſſe we will ſeeke light in the darkeneſſe.

                  <p>There were many judgements of the ſaid court of parliament, wherby the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">

As of the image of our Ladie, which was painted in an old Table, that had many yeares remained in a painters ſhop for a ſhew: which Table, a Curate nigh unto Paris, bought good cheape, and boring two holes, where the two eyes were of that noble Ladie, and at the time when vines weepe, placed behind in them two ſprigs of the vine tree, ſo that pitifull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die wept in the church where ſhe ſtood, which drew great numbers of pilgrimes to that pariſh: inſomuch, that the painter himſelfe and his wife came thither alſo in great devotion, who had ſold it. But this marred all, that they at laſt knew it to bee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the old Table, which had ſo long kept their ſhop: by whome the fame of this abuſe came to the knowledge of juſtice, whereby, by the ſaid parliament the Curate was condemned, and the Table burnt.</p>
                  <p>But another time the ſaid Court of parliament of Paris did another thing that ſeemed ſomething to hold of <hi>Machiavels</hi> opinion. For upon a controverſie of law which happened betwixt the Cleargie men of our Lady in Paris, which ſaid, That they had S. <hi>Denis</hi> his head, and the Abbots and religious men of S. <hi>Denis,</hi> which ſaid, That they had the whole body of S. <hi>Denis.</hi> The Court there gave judgement, That they of S. <hi>Denis</hi> had the whole body of S. <hi>Denis</hi> the Athenian, and they of our Lady, the head of S. <hi>Denis</hi> the Corinthian. So that they both were content, although

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> before, there was never heard of any S. <hi>Denis</hi> the Corinthian. But that was all one, they provided, that their practiſe diminiſhed not. If they of Ratisbone in Almaigne had intermedled with this ſtrife, it would have been hard to have agreed them, or els there muſt have been ſuppoſed a third S. <hi>Denis:</hi> for they ſay alſo, that they have the whole body of S. <hi>Denis,</hi> and have a declarative ſentence of a Pope and his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, to confirme it (as they ſay.)

                  <p>True it is, that our Chriſtian Religion teacheth us, humilitie towards God. For we ought to acknowledge before his face, that we are poore ſinners, and to demand pardon of him, as criminall perſons doe, which fall on their knees before a prince, begging grace and pardon. Wee ought alſo to acknowledge, that the graces wee have, proceed from God, and that we ought not to bee proud of any good thing in us. Moreover, we ought to be modeſt and gentle towards our neighbour, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt all fierceneſſe and crueltie. But doe thoſe things debaſe and unable the hearts

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of good men to performe and execute their duties of fortitude and valiantneſſe in warre? Doth this Chriſtian humilitie diminiſh their generoſitie? I will aske the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this point of none other, but even of <hi>Machiavell</hi> his own nation, which heretofore have come into Fraunce, to make warre againſt the Evangelickes. For they have well felt, if the humilitie of Chriſtians have ſo much abated the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hearts, that they durſt not well handle them (as they ſay) both backes &amp; bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: yet if they will not confeſſe it; the fields, which are white with their bones, will alwayes give good witneſſe thereof. It is ſtrange, that this villainous Atheiſt durſt utter and ſend abroad ſo abſurd things, which are ſo farre from all experience and truth. If that which he ſaith were truth, it ſhould follow, That no Chriſtian prince

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> could ſtand againſt Paynim and Infidell princes: but all auncient and moderne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, doe they not ſhew us the contrarie? The emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great was a verie humble Chriſtian prince, yea of that humilitie (as ſome write) as he held the ſtirrop of the Pope of Rome, till he got on horſeback; yet he vanquiſhed <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Emperours and kings Chriſtians victorious of Painims.</note> who was a Paynim emperour with him, and made him forſake the empire, and beſides overcame many Paynim nations, as we have ſaid in an other place. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was ſo humble, that being reprehended for a certaine fault he had committed, by <hi>S.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and by that meanes was received to the Communion: yet although hee was ſo humble, he had verie great and goodlie victories againſt the Barbarians and Infidels, and againſt other enemies of the Romane empire.

                  <p>When I thinke upon and conſider where <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath fiſhed this goodlie Maxime, I can hardlie be perſuaded but he learned it out of the hiſtorie of <hi>Aygolant</hi>

                     </note> a Paynim king of Affrica, of <hi>Mahumets</hi> religion: this king was a great and puiſſant ruler, who demeaned and maintained great warres with <hi>Charlemaine</hi> king of France, but he was alwaies vanquiſhed, and <hi>Charlemaine</hi> victorious; ſo that to eſcape from the hands of <hi>Charlemaine</hi> by the cheapeſt and beſt means, he could deviſe none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than one day to make <hi>Charlemaine</hi> underſtand, that he the ſaid <hi>Aygolant,</hi> would become a Chriſtian, and be baptized: <hi>Charlemaine</hi> rejoyced therat, and cauſed him to come into his lodging, with intent to feaſt him, &amp; give him good enterteinment.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> apparrelled, eating on the ground without cloath, as beggars vſe to do; which <hi>Charlemaine</hi> did, to have alwaies before his eyes an image of povertie, to remember Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and their humilitie: <hi>Aygolant</hi> at the ſight of theſe poore men, deſired to know what they were; <hi>Charlemaine</hi> aunſwered him; Theſe be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God: yea ſaid <hi>Aygolant,</hi> hath thy God his ſervants in ſo evill order, and are thy ſervants ſo brave; trulie I will never bee baptiſed, to become the ſervant of thy God, for I will never yeeld to ſo baſe an eſtate, as I ſee thy Gods ſervants hold: ſo <hi>Aygolant</hi> would not bee chriſtened, for the humilitie he ſaw in the eſtate of God his ſervants. So <hi>Machiavell</hi> rejecteth the Chriſtian Religion, becauſe that thereby hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie is recommended unto us: but loveth much better the Paynim Religion of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>Aygolant,</hi> becauſe (ſaith he) it maintaineth the heart, haughtie and fierce.</p>
                  <p>And as for that that he ſaith, That the Chriſtian Religion promiſeth not Paradice <note place="margin">Chriſtian Religion alloweth not an idle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative life.</note> but to idle &amp; contemplative people, he ſheweth well that he never knew what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion meant; for it commandeth us to travaile, &amp; not to be idle, and everie man loyallie to exerciſe his vocation. Verie true it is, that amongſt Chriſtians there muſt be ſome contemplatives, that is to ſay, ſtudious people, which give themſelves to holie letters, for to teach others: but we finde not by the documents of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, That there is allowed any idle contemplation of dreamers, which doe no other thing but imagine dreames, and toyes, in their braines: but a contemplative life of labouring ſtudious people, is only approoved, which give themſelves to let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to teach others: for after they have accompliſhed their ſtudies, they ought to put in uſe and action, that which they know; bringing into an active life, that which they have learned by their ſtudie in their contemplative life; and they which uſe this otherwiſe, follow not the precepts of the true Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>Touching that which he ſaith; That the Chriſtian Religion diſpoſeth rather men to receive blowes, than to vengeance. I confeſſe that it is true, that our Religion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21818:64"/>
us to take vengeance of our owne enmities and particular quarrels, by our

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> owne authoritie; but the way and courſe of juſtice is not denied us. And if it were lawfull for everie one to vſe vengeance; that ſhould be to introduce a confuſion and diſorder into the commonwealth, &amp; to enterprice upon the right which belongeth to the magiſtrate, unto whom God hath given the ſword, to doe right to everie one, and to puniſh ſuch as are faultie, according to their merites: but what is all this to purpoſe, touching the generoſitie of hart that men ſhould have in war? for although a man ſhould not be quarrelous nor vindictative, to find quarrels for needles points, yet will he not ceaſe to performe his dutie in warfare, for the ſervice of his prince; yet <note place="margin">Men that are not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellous, are not the leſſe generous.</note> is there one point in Chriſtians, more then in Paynims, that is; That a Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well reſolved in his conſcience, that he beareth armes for a good and juſt cauſe, as for the good of his prince, or of his countrey, or ſome ſuch like good cauſe, hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> will leſſe eſteeme of his life, and will more willingly hazard it, than a Paynim or an Infidell will doe: becauſe hee hath a firme truſt and beleefe, that hee ſhall enjoy the eternall life after this fraile life. <hi>Caeſar</hi> writeth, That our auncient Gaules were very generous and warlike, becauſe they held as reſolute the immortalitie of ſoules, and that they that die, die not at all. How much more then ought Chriſtians to bee ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, which not onely are reſolved of the immortalitie of ſoules, but do alſo know, that God hath prepared for them an eternall reſt, an immortall glorie, and a perdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beatitude, with him and his angels? Surely, as the life and eternall felicitie are more excellent, than this fraile life full of miſeries and calamities: ſo the Chriſtian

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> will never doubt nor feare, to change the one for the other, but with a magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and generous heart, will willingly alwaies beſtow his life in a juſt quarrell. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavell</hi> and all his ſchoole of Atheiſts, which have nothing, that ſo much fears their conſcience, as to thinke of God, have no ſuch mind. They ſhew themſelves generous and valiant to execute ſome maſſacre, to ſley men unarmed, which have no meanes to defend themſelves: but otherwiſe they are reſolute people to hold themſelves far from blowes.</p>
                  <p>Finally, when <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, That the Chriſtian Religion teacheth us to deſpiſe <note place="margin">A Chriſtian may deſire honour by lawfull meanes.</note> honor, he ſhewes himſelfe a ſtinking lier. True it is, that a man muſt diſtinguiſh the vertue, and that which is good, from that which is the vice, and the evill which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> it. For ambition is a vice which commeth very nigh the deſire of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which good men ought to have. If then a man travaile and take paines to come to ſome eſtate and greatneſſe by all lawfull and unlawfull meanes, and beeing come thereunto, uſeth it fiercely and to his own commoditie, rather than to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Commonwealth: we confeſſe, that our Religion teacheth us to flie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe ſuch honours. But when a man will maintaine himſelfe by all honeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes in a good and entire reputation, although by ſuch meanes he aſpire to ſome eſtate and dignitie, whereof he feeles himſelfe capable, well to uſe it, and to ſerve God and the Commonweale therein; we ſay, That by our Chriſtian Religion there is not forbidden us ſuch an aeffectation of honor, and, that lawfully wee may,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> yea, we ought to ſeeke and purſue to have ſuch an honor. Breefely, the thing which Chriſtians hold moſt precious and deare, is their conſcience towards God, and their honour amongſt men.</p>

                     <hi>M. Philip de Comines,</hi> king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh his chamberlaine, writeth, That this king was very humble in habits, in words, and in all other things, and that hee could well acknowledge his faults, and amend them, and that theſe vertues were the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21818:64"/>

                  <p>So muſt we ſay, That humilitie, kindneſſe, gentleneſſe, patience, eaſineſſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, clemencie, and all other vertues, which accord and agree with an humane and benigne nature, are not contrarie to the true magnanimitie, but very covenable and agreeing thereunto. For magnanimitie is no other thing but a conſtant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall will, to employ himſelfe couragiouſly in all good and vertuous things, and to flie, abate, and chaſe away all vices and vicious things. It is then magnamitie, to be humble, ſoft, gentle, patient, enclined to pardon, to be farre from vengeance,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſince all thoſe things are vertues, and not vices. And by the contrarie, it is puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie, to bee proud, rigorous, ſharpe, impatient, vindicate and cruell: becauſe all thoſe things are vices, and not vertues. For that vertue of Magnanimitie is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accompanied with the ſaid vices, neither receives them to wait upon her, onely ſhe is waited upon with all other vertues. And for example hereof, there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men more moderate, more humble, and gentle, nor more enclined to pardon, than were, <hi>Scipio</hi> the African, than <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> than <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, than great <hi>Pompeius?</hi> Yet were there never in the world, men, which were more magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous than they.</p>

But I ſhall in another place handle this point more at large, and ſhew, That magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath alwayes been joyned with humanitie, gentleneſſe, and clemencie: and contrarie, puſillanimitie hath alwaies beene accompanied with crueltie, pride, and vengeance.</p>

For there are at this day infinit perſons, which ſo much pleaſe themſelves in prophane authors, ſome in Poets, ſome in Hyſtoriographers, ſome in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, ſome in Phyſick, or in Law; that they care nothing to reade or els to know any

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> reſerve that ſtudie, till they have ended the ſtudies of other ſciences, &amp; in the mean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>while the time runneth away, and oftentimes it commeth to paſſe, that when they muſt needs diſlodge out of this world, their prophane ſtudies are not ended, nor the ſtudie of holy letters commenced, and ſo die they like beaſts. Therefore are not the old doctors any thing to be reprehended, becauſe they admoniſh men to reade in great ſobrietie the writings of Paynims, and that men give not themſelves ſo much thereunto, as for to know humane ſciences, they abandon and let goe the divine knowledge, which is as much more excellent than they, as God is more excellent than man. Yet is there ſome Paynim authors, which ought never to be read of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or at the leaſt ought not to come in the hands of youths, which of themſelves

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are but too much enclined to vices and lubricities. For a young ſcholler can hee better learne in a ſtewes amongſt whores and ruffians, the tearmes of all villanie and lubricitie, than in that filthie <hi>Martiall,</hi> or in <hi>Catullus</hi> or <hi>Tibullus,</hi> or in certain books of <hi>Ovid?</hi> And therefore, although wee never read any of theſe poets, and ſo our youth gave themſelves only to <hi>Virgil</hi> to learne all Latine poëſie, it were ynough: and that alone author (out of whom all others are but ſmall rivers) might learne them all the poëſie that need be knowne. Yet I will not ſay, but there are many other good poets very worthy to be read, as <hi>Horace, Lucane, Claudian,</hi> and others; but hee that well underſtands <hi>Virgil,</hi> he needs not have to doe with others, for the underſtanding of poëſie. And in every ſcience it ſeemeth to be the beſt (that men may well employ

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their time, which is deare and ſhort) to reade few bookes, to make good choiſe of them, and well to underſtand them. But for proofe of this which I come to ſay, and to ſhew, that <hi>Machiavell</hi> is a ſhameleſſe lier, in that he dare affirm, That the doctors of the Chriſtian Religion would or ſought to aboliſh good letters, I will here ſet downe the advice and counſell that they have given touching the ſtudie of humane letters of the Gentiles. Doctor <hi>Beda</hi> (as <hi>Gratian</hi> reciteth in his decree) ſayth; That they which will forbid the reading of the Gentiles bookes, do hinder men from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Aegyptians and Chaldeans, doe ſerve us for an example, not utterly to reject the humane letters of the Paynims. But here I will tranſlate the very words of Doctor <hi>Beda.</hi> 
                     <q>He troubleth (ſayth hee) and cauſeth to faile the vivacitie of readers ſpirits, who eſteemeth, that men ought altogether to forbid the reading of ſecular bookes, wherein we ought to take that which is good, as our own. Otherwiſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> would not have learned the wiſedome and letters of the Aegyptians and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, the ſuperſtition of which people they abhorred. S. <hi>Paule</hi> alſo doctor of the Gentiles, would not have alledged certaine verſes out of the Gentiles bookes in his writings. Why then ſhould we forbid men to read that which by good reaſon ought to be read? But ſome reade ſecular letters for their pleaſure only, beeing tickled and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> delighted with poëticall figments and fictions, or els for the ornament of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: others read them for their erudition, and to deteſt and confute the errors of the Gentiles, and to applie and make ſerve the good things that they find there, to the uſe of the erudition of ſacred letters; and theſe verily doe merit only praiſe, by ſtudying of ſecular letters. And for this cauſe S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> reprehended a certaine bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, not becauſe he had learned humane letters, but becauſe he expounded them
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21818:66"/>
unto the people againſt the dutie of a Biſhop, whereas hee ſhould have expounded

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Goſpell.</q> Behold what was the opinion of this Theologian doctor, touching the ſtudie and reading of the writings and ſciences of the Paynims. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon S. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame matter, ſaith, That we reade the bookes of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims to divers ends; namely, for not to be ignorant of that they handle, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the good things in them, and to reject the evill. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> upon the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> ſayth, That Grammar and Logicke are profitable ſciences to know to ſpeake well, and to diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe, and that ſciences humane may ſerve Chriſtians, to apply them to good uſes: and therefore (ſaith he) it is neceſſarie of neceſſitie to know them, to the end, that we might ſhew, That the things which have been ſaid by the Prophets many hundreth of years before, are ſince come to paſſe,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and deſcribed by the bookes both of the Greekes and Latines. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> alſo againſt the Manicheans, ſaith, That if the <hi>Sibils,</hi> or <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or that other poets of the Gentiles, or the philoſophers have written any true thing of God, men muſt and may ſerve themſelves therewith, to vanquiſh the vanitie of the Paynims, but yet ought we not therefore to give authoritie to ſuch authors. By which words he well ſhewes, that he approoveth the reading and ſtudie of the Gentiles bookes, as well poets, philoſophers, as others. S. <hi>Baſile</hi> alſo in his treatiſe he writ of the manner of reading the Gentiles bookes, not onely reprehendeth not the reading thereof, but contrarie exhorteth Chriſtians to reade them, and to applie the reading of thoſe bookes to his true end and purpoſe, which is the pietie and edification in the faith

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and Chriſtian Religion. And to conclude, we read, that by a Counſell it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, That every where ſchooles ſhould be eſtabliſhed to teach youth humane letters and liberall arts. <q>The article of the ſaid Counſell, recited by <hi>Gratian</hi> in his Decretall, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> 37 <hi>Diſt.</hi>
                        </note> is this: Report is made unto us of certaine places, where they have no care to have ſchoolemaſters for the ſtudie of letters: therefore let all biſhops, ſubjects, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in place where need ſhall be, performe their duties in placing maſters and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which may daily teach letters and liberall arts, for by their meanes the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and commandements of God are declared and manifeſted.</q> What now then will this ſlanderer <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſay? Can hee yet ſay, that the doctors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion have or would have aboliſhed good letters, and the writings of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Paynims? Will he not hold himſelfe vanquiſhed of a lie by ſo many authorities, as we have alledged of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> S. <hi>Gregorie, Baeda,</hi> and S. <hi>Baſile,</hi> which are the principall doctors of the Chriſtian Church, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Counſell (which is as an approbation of the univerſall Church?) ſhall not all this be ſufficient to ſhew the impudencie of this Florentine?</p>
                  <p>But now am I deſirous to know of this Atheiſt <hi>Machiavell,</hi> what was the cauſe that ſo manie good bookes of the Paynim authors were loſt, ſince the time of the auncient doctors of our Chriſtian Religion? was it not by the Gothes which were Paynims? For at their ſo manie irruptions and breaking out of their countries, upon Gaule, Italie, Spaine, they waſted and burned ſo many bookes as they could finde,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> being enemies of all learning and letters: and who within this hundreth yeares hath reſtored good letters, conteined in the bookes of the auncient Paynims, Grecians, and Latins? hath it beene the Turke, who is a Paynim? It is well enough knowne, that he is an enemie of letters, and deſireth none. Nay contrarie, it hath beene the Chriſtians which have reſtored them, and eſtabliſhed them in the brightneſſe and light wherein we ſee them at this day. The knowledge of the Greeke, Latin, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21818:66"/>
tongues in other countries, have beene brought in by others; but into our

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> countries of France, that they have come and doe ſo flouriſh, wee may thanke king <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of happie memorie: and ſince the reſtauration of tongues and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſciences, men have well experimented, that they are verie requiſite and profi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table, well to underſtand the Scriptures of our Chriſtian Religion, ſo farre are wee off from rejecting them.</p>
                  <p>And as for that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith; That our Chriſtian Religion hath ſought to aboliſh the memorie of all antiquitie; how dare he openlie oppugne the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt truth? for none is ignorant, that the true and primative antiquitie is of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, whoſe bookes have been conſerved, tranſlated, &amp; expounded by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And as for the antiquitie of the Paynims, doth any man finde that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> have cauſed to periſh <hi>Homer, Heſiodus, Beroſus,</hi> or any other authors of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? nay they they are which have conſerved them, which have aided themſelves with them, and which have interpreted them: <hi>Euſtachius</hi> the great commentor of <hi>Homer,</hi> was not he a Chriſtian, yea a biſhop? But I ſhame to ſtay in the confutation of the impudent lies of this Atheiſt; for young and meane ſchollers may eaſilie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne his impudent lies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith; That it ſucceeded not ſo well with our Chriſtian Religion, as it would, when it went about to aboliſh good letters, becauſe it was conſtreined to uſe the Latin tongue, wherein all humane ſciences were written. Herein doth he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtlie ſhew his beaſtlineſſe and ignorance; for who conſtreined our Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to write in Latin? the olde and new Teſtament were firſt written in Hebrew and Greeke: therefore the Latin doctors if they had liſt, might have written in theſe languages, as did S. <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi> S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> S. <hi>Baſile,</hi> S. <hi>Cirill, Euſebius,</hi> and manie others: yet if writers had uſed theſe languages, men would nor have ceaſed to preach in Latin to the Latins; in the French to the French; in the Allemaigne to the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maignes, and to other nations, to everie one in his language: for it hath been ſeene not paſt threeſcore yeares agoe, that in Italie, France, Alemaigne, Spaine, and other where, the Chriſtian Religion was not written in the mothers tongue; yet men left not to hold the ſaid Religion in the ſaid countries: but ſince it hath beene brought into everie of thoſe languages, for the commoditie of the people; as it was brought

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> into the Latin tongue by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and other Latin doctors of the primitive Church of their time: yet if they had written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, or Greeke, the Chriſtian Religion had not left and ceaſed to ſubſiſt and ſtand for that. And although the Latin prophane books had periſhed, the Latin language which then was vulgar, had not therefore periſhed: therefore doth <hi>Machiavell</hi> well ſhew his beaſtlineſſe, to ſay, that the Chriſtian Religion hath beene conſtrained to uſe the Latin language, and that by that meanes, the prophane Latin authors have beene conſerved. But what means he when he ſaith; That if the Chriſtian Religion could have formed a new tongue, it had aboliſhed the memorie of all antiquitie? hath there been at any time, in any countrie, any Religion, which hath formed a new

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> language? and how comes it, that a Religion can bee received by the meanes of a new unknowne tongue? If the Chriſtian Religion had invented a new tongue, it could never have been underſtood, nor received, and by conſequent could not have aboliſhed the bookes written in the Latin tongue: likewiſe uſing the Latin tongue that was in common uſe, it could no more aboliſh the books written in that tongue, according to the ſaying of the ſaid <hi>Machiavell:</hi> and therefore take it which way you
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21818:67"/>
will; if the Chriſtian Religion had invented a new tongue, or that it had uſed the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Latin tongue (as it did and doth) it could not extinguiſh &amp; aboliſh the bookes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Latin tongue; therefore <hi>Machiavell</hi> knows not what he ſaith.</p>
                  <p>As little knoweth he what he ſaith, when he holds, That ſects and Religions have varied twiſe or thrice, in five or ſixe thouſand yeares, and that the laſt cauſeth alwaies the remembrance of the firſt to periſh; for who hath revealed unto him this ſecret? who hath told him newes of things done before <hi>Moſes</hi> time, if it were not <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe? Brieflie, there is neither reaſon, nor hiſtorie, whereupon he may found that impudent lie. But hereby he would ſhew, that if any doubt whether he be not a very Atheiſt, that he hath no more cauſe to doubt: for, for a proofe hereof, he makes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that he beleeves nothing of that which is written in the holy Scripture, of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the creation of the world, nor of the Religion of God, which wee hold ſince <hi>Moſes.</hi> For by the holy Scripture it is ſeene, that there are not yet ſix thouſand yeares ſince the creation of the world. It is alſo ſeene, that the Chriſtian Religion of <hi>Meſsias</hi> and Chriſt, changed not ſince the ſaid creation, but hath alwaies endured, and ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure till the conſumation of the world. And as for Painim Religions, they have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from one into an other, in a little time, and in one ſame countrie, as hiſtories do ſhew. At Rome, in the time of <hi>Romulus,</hi> there was a Religion ſuch as it was, which <hi>Numa</hi> changed, and deviſed an other more cerimonious. After, the religion of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> changed, &amp; ſtrange Religions of the Grecians &amp; others were received at Rome: inſomuch that about five hundreth yeares after <hi>Numa,</hi> when his bookes were found

So that in breefe, <hi>Machiavell</hi> his mind is, That a man ſhould do well to ſet a packing the Chriſtian Religion, &amp; that it were a goodly

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thing alwayes to live in the Paynim Religion. What an impietie is this, I pray you?

I beſeech therefore all them which feare God, to accept thoſe reaſons, as lawfull excuſes, that I am ſo often forced to ſpeake and write ſo impious and abhominable ſpeeches<hi>:</hi> for although it diſpleaſeth me much to do ſo, yet I dare not but lay abroad the impietie of this poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. He then ſaith, That it was a goodly thing in the time of the Paynims, to ſee the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> world abuſed with that falſe opinion (for ſuch he accounteth it) of oracles and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guries; but that it was a great miſchiefe, and evill luck, when the world began, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that ſuch things were falſe, faigned, and deviſed of men; becauſe then the world began to become exceeding wicked, prompt, and willing to all euill, as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained ſlave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Machiavell</hi> then muſt note by his owne confeſſion, That men then became moſt <note place="margin">Atheiſme brings men to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all wickednes.</note> wicked in all wickedneſſe, as ſoone as they began to bee of the Heathen Religion, that is, without all Religion. What meanes <hi>Machiavell</hi> then openly to teach A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, and the deſpight of the Chriſtian Religion? yet this he ſpeaks not, to bring us unto Paganiſme, which hee confeſſeth to bee falſe: but to make men, eſpecially

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> princes and great lords (for whoſe inſtruction he writ his bookes) utterly to forſake all pietie, and to bring them to the higheſt degree of wickedneſſe, whereunto hee ſaith they come, which are of no Religion. But when princes or others have taken that goodly inſtruction, and offered that mockerie unto God and Religion, they but advance their owne infallible confuſion, and ruine of their eſtates, as we have in an other place demonſtrated by examples.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the truth of that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſayth, certaine it is, That as ſoone as Chriſtian Religion came into light and knowledge, the Paynim Religion vaniſhed away by little and little, as the light alſo by little and little ſpread it ſelfe. True it is alſo, that as ſoone as the falſeneſſe of the Paynim Religion was diſcovered,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> there were ſome, which notwithſtanding, would not be brought to the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And as for ſuch, I doubt not but they became alwayes worſe, forſaking the Paynim Religion, as falſe, to follow Atheiſme. No leſſe may we well ſay of our time, wherein we may ſee many, which contemne all Religion, becauſe they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and ſeeke after the true Religion, whereof they delight to be ignorant, to the end, it may not torment their wicked conſciences, nor controule their diſordinate covetouſneſſe. But as wee ſee many which are not ſatisfied nor contented to know the errors wherein they were wrapped, but alſo they have well deſired to know the truth, which they ought to hold. So when the Paynim Religion ended, they which forſooke it, contented not themſelves in knowing it was falſe, but they alſo thought

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> good to know the true, which is the Chriſtian, the light whereof, made the other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away. And indeed, by little and little every one embraced the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there remaining, but certaine Porphyries and Lucians, which would bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion. And would to God that our world were as pure from Atheiſme, as that world was; then ſhould wee not ſee ſo many miſeries and calamities which are in the world.</p>

And as for that that <hi>Machiavell</hi> preſuppoſeth, That Oracles were certaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> deviſed at the pleaſure of prieſts, to deceive men in the Temples of <hi>Apollo,</hi> of <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> or of any other of the Paynim gods, he ſheweth himſelfe to be very ignorant, and to have read little: yet I will not deny, but ſometimes the prieſts entermedled ſomewhat of their owne many times: but it is certaine, that the ſaid Oracles, were diabolicall anſweres, which the devill made himſelfe, or cauſed to bee made by ſome hee or ſhee prieſt, which he brought into extaſies, and out of their ſences, and ſo cauſed them to ſay what hee would: and moſt often hee anſwered in verſes, but commonly ambiguous, in two ſences. For how could thoſe hee or ſhee prieſts, which commonly were unlearned, and knew nothing, give an anſwere in verſe. It was alſo impoſſible, that they could have advertiſements from Religions ſo

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> farre off, as men came to conſult of thoſe Oracles, yea, eſpecially of ſuch particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, whereof ordinarily anſweres were demanded of thoſe Oracles, to bee able to give anſweres to any good purpoſe. But I will not ſtay more amply to proove this point: for they which have read very little of ancient writings, know well how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that theſe Oracles were voices proceeding from devils, which the Painims ſerved under theſe names, of <hi>Apollo,</hi> of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and other like gods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarke</hi> in a treatiſe he made of the defect of Oracles, ſheweth, That the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were not things invented by prieſts; but concerning the failing of Oracles, he is found very much diſtracted and troubled, not knowing how to reſolve that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. For there muſt be preſuppoſed, that in his time (which was during the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the emperor <hi>Traianus)</hi> and before a good while, there were no more Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: inſomuch, that that good philoſopher was much abaſhed and perplexed, from whence it ſhould come. But becauſe that point is well woorth the knowledge, and dooth come well for our purpoſe in this place, I will handle the ſame more at large.</p>
                  <p>You muſt then underſtand, that <hi>Plutarke,</hi> who was a great Paynim philoſopher, <note place="margin">Of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failance of Oracles.</note> to finde out the cauſe of the failing and decay of Oracles, entreth into a queſtion, whereof he (like a Paynim) reſolves himſelfe: but to prove his opinion, he uſeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine narrations, which may well bring us to the truth of the cauſe of the defailancie and ceaſing of Oracles. He then entreth into diſputation of the nature of the gods;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and after many diſcourſes, hee reſolveth, that there are but one ſort of gods, which the Elders called Demi-gods, which are mortall; although they lived long, as five hundred or a thouſand years; and he thinketh, that theſe demi-gods are they which the gods have engendred with mortall women. For the auncient ſuperſtition (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with certaine philoſophers have beene led) beleeved, that the gods ſometimes deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended below, to cohabitate with women: and this ſerved to keepe the honours of great Ladies, which ſometimes forgot their duties. <hi>Plutarke</hi> then, would hereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that it might be, thoſe gods which anſwered at Delphos and Delos, and other places, were but halfe gods, and ſo might be dead, and that therefore might happen the ſaid ceaſing of Oracles. Yet hee held not this opinion nor any other very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> but he propoundeth it for ſuch as would like it, and it ſeemes to be the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he himſelfe beſt approveth. But I doe not thinke, that any at this day will be of this opinion: for in truth it taſteth of his Paganiſme, being ignorant and far ſtraying from the true knowledge of God &amp; of Religion: yet to prove, that the ſaid demigods are mortal, he makes a diſcourſe very notable and worthy the knowledge. <note place="margin">An hyſtorie of the death of the god <hi>Pan.</hi>
                     </note> He ſaith then, that in the time of the emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> one <hi>Epitherſes,</hi> a ſchoole-maſter
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21818:69"/>
in a towne of Greece, embarked himſelfe upon the ſea, to ſaile into Italie,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and placed himſelfe in a ſhip charged with marchandize, and wherein there were many people. Making their way, they paſſed one day at night nigh unto the Iſlands called Echinades, and there the ſea was ſo calme, that they could perceive no wind, inſomuch, that the ſhip floating upon the water, brought them by little and little nigh unto Paxo. Where being arrived, as ſome ſupped, and other did other things, behold an high and intelligible voice, which cried <hi>Thamus, Thamus.</hi> This <hi>Thamus</hi> was the maſter of the ſhip, whoſe name the moſt part of the paſſengers knew not. This voice cried twice, before the maſter would anſwere. At the third time hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, unto which the voice yet cried with an higher ſound, That as ſoone as hee ſhould be come againſt the Palodes, he ſhould make knowne unto the inhabitants

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> there, that the great <hi>Pan</hi> was dead. <hi>Epitherſes</hi> ſaid, That at that word, all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie which were within the ſhip, were exceedingly afraid and aſtoniſhed. So it came into a conſultation amongſt that people, if the ſhipmaſter <hi>Thamus</hi> ſhould doe that which was commanded him by that voice. And this reſolution was taken, That if when they came againſt the Palodes, the winds were ſtrong and good for them, they ſhould paſſe on without ſtay, or ſaying any thing; but if the ſea were calme, and had no winde, that then <hi>Thamus</hi> ſhould ſignifie unto the inhabitants of Palodes that which the voice had commaunded him. Beeing then there arrived, and having the ſea calme without wind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Thamus</hi> got him into the hind-decke or ſterne of the ſhip, and turning his face towards land right againſt Palodes, hee begun to crie with an

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> high voice, <hi>The great</hi> Pan <hi>is dead.</hi> He had no ſooner atchieved &amp; ended this ſpeech, but all the whole companie in the ſhip heard a great crying and lamentation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, mixed with a great admiration. Finally, when they were arrived at Rome, each of them within the ſhip ſpread abroad the fame of this thing, inſomuch, that it came to the notice of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the emperour; who ſent for the captaine or maſter of the ſhip, <hi>Thamus,</hi> who told him al at length. <hi>Tiberius</hi> beleeving it was true, that the great god <hi>Pan</hi> was dead, deſired to know what god that was. Some learned people which he had about him, told him: That that <hi>Pan</hi> was the ſonne of god <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and of <hi>Penelope.</hi> Behold here the account which <hi>Plutarke</hi> makes of god <hi>Pan</hi> his death, and further ſayth, That in his time many heard this hyſtorie rehearſed by one <hi>Aemilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſonne of the ſaid <hi>Epitherſes.</hi> But if we conſider the circumſtances of this hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, we ſhall find, That this voice was a ſignification of the death of Chriſt, which cauſed Oracles to faile, and overthrew the power of the devill. And it is credible, that thoſe lamentations which were heard at Palodes, were the complaints of evill ſpirits, to which were delivered the ſignification of their kingdomes deſtruction. And to prove that this hyſtorie ſhould bee ſo underſtood. Firſt wee muſt conſider, that it is reported to be in the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> under whom our Lord Ieſus ſuffered death and paſſion. Certaine alſo it is, That <hi>Tiberius</hi> enquired of Ieſus Chriſt, and underſtanding of his miracles, he required of the Senat, that they would cauſe him to be enrolled in the Letanie of their gods at Rome; but the Senat would not. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> credible it is, that in the time of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, when amongſt the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims the fame was diſperſed of Chriſts miracles, as to raiſe to life the dead from their graves, to make ſee ſuch as were borne blind, to heale Paralatike perſons, and ſuch like, that they beleeved that he was God: for upon leſſe reaſons they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved others. And becauſe he called himſelfe the true ſhepheard, and the ſhepheard of ſhepheards, it is very likely, that the Paynims underſtanding this, would divine
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21818:69"/>
and gather, that it muſt needs bee the god <hi>Pan,</hi> which they ſaid to bee the god of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſhepheards: and becauſe alſo that hee ſaid, that hee was ſent of god his father to preach to men his will, they ſometimes alſo gave him the name of <hi>Mercurie,</hi> whom they ſaid to be the meſſenger and deliverer of the will of the great god <hi>Iupiter.</hi> This may be gathered by <hi>Dion,</hi> the hyſtoriographer, who ſaith: That the emperour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> making warre againſt the Marcommans, obtained raine from heaven of the <note place="margin">Dion &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol. in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Antonino.</note> god <hi>Mercurie.</hi> And <hi>Capitolinus</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame matter, ſaith, That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> to obtaine raine, had recourſe to a ſtrange Religion: but <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> was no ſtrange god to thoſe Paynims, ſo that we muſt needs underſtand that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Dion,</hi> of another <hi>Mercurie</hi> than they knew; yet gave they him that name (as it is likely) becauſe they had heard ſay he was ſent from God, to ſignifie and preach

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his will. To come againe then to our purpoſe, the aforeſaid learned men that were about <hi>Tiberius</hi> the emperour, hearing it ſpoken, that ſo many miracles were done by Ieſus Chriſt, they eaſily reſolved, that he was a god; underſtanding he called himſelf the great ſhepheard, they concluded thereof, that hee was <hi>Pan;</hi> hearing alſo, that he ſaid he was ſent to deliver out the will of God, and that he was borne of a virgin, they made this illation (as is to be preſumed) that he muſt then needs bee the ſonne of <hi>Mercurie,</hi> meſſenger of the great <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and of ſome chaſt woman, ſuch as was <hi>Penelope:</hi> for as is likely, they could never beleeve, that hee was a virgins ſonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it repugned the order of nature, that a virgin ſhould bring forth a child. And therefore of all thoſe conjectures laid together, thoſe wiſe men (or rather ignorant)

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which were about the emperour, gathered the aforeſaid anſwere, which they made him, That the god <hi>Pan,</hi> which died at that time, was the ſonne of <hi>Mercurie</hi> and of <hi>Penelope;</hi> applying that to their gods, which they had heard ſpoken of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Behold then, how this hyſtorie, drawne from the Paynims, is a perfect witneſſe, that by the death of Chriſt came the defailancie and ceaſing of Oracles: and indeed wee find in no hyſtories, that ſince his death Oracles have been of any account or fame, as they were before. True it is, that the men and women prieſts of thoſe gods, which anſwered by Oracles, ſeeing that their maſter abandoned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke them, yet delivered anſweres themſelves of their own devices; but their trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, deceits, and fictions, were ſoone diſcovered by the divulgement and diſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Chriſtian Religion, in ſuch ſort, as the Oracles and the Oracle deliverers became greatly diſcredited. <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe diſcovering the abuſe, overthrew one <note place="margin">Dion in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone.</note> of the temples of <hi>Apollo,</hi> wherein were delivered Oracles, and ſlew all the prieſts belonging thereunto.</p>
                  <p>For a reſolution then I hold; That at the comming of our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, Oracles failed, as the comming of the Sunne cauſeth darkeneſſe to depart from the <note place="margin">At the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt the world was amended.</note> earth: at his comming hee preached the true and pure heavenly doctrine to men, and after him his Apoſtles and Diſciples preached it alſo: ſo that by the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles &amp; Diſciples, all Chriſtians were inſtructed to feare, love, and honour God above all things, and to ſerve him according to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in puritie and ſimplicitie, rejecting all idolatries, ſuperſtitions, and divine ſervices, invented by men. Moreover, they are in true doctrine taught good maners, to love their neighbours as themſelves, and none to doe to another that which hee would not to be done to himſelfe; to uſe towards his, the like ſame charitie that each one would ſhould be uſed to him; to obey ſuperiors and magiſtrates; to live conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every one in the vocation whereunto God hath called him; yea generally Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21818:70"/>
were taught in all true vertue, whereas before the Paynims did teach nothing

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> (as I may ſay) but the maske and reſemblance of vertue. For Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles taught men to be juſt, charitable, temperant, gentle, obedient, pitifull, loving good, ſhunning evill, and they taught not ſo to be outwardly onely, but inwardly alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feignedneſſe, or any diſſimulation of heart: whereas the Paynims cared not to be inwardly vertuous and mannerly, ſo that in outward appearance they ſhew ſo to <note place="margin">The vertue of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> be, to obtaine honour, glorie, and advauncement unto greatneſſe, which was the marke and end, for which commonly they deſired vertue, and not for conſcience ſake, nor to pleaſe God. The examples of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> of <hi>Pompey,</hi> of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and generally of all the old Romanes (which have had any great reputation of vertue) doe prove, that this is true, and that they never aſpired to verrue, but to obtaine honour, and to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> encreaſe their greatneſſe. <hi>Cato</hi> likewiſe of Vtica, which ſeemed in all his behaviors to deſpiſe honour, wherefore ſlew he himſelfe? Was it to pleaſe God, or to ſatisfie his conſcience? It is very certaine that no: for he was not ſo ignorant, but he knew well, that murder diſpleaſed God, and that no man ſhould murder himſelfe, more than another. Nothing could move his conſcience, to incite him to ſlay himſelfe: for he felt not himſelfe culpable of any thing that deſerved it. How then? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould he murder himſelfe? For this, not to receive that diſhonour, to fall alive into the hands of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> although he knew well ynough, that there needed no more but a little humiliation, to have his life, goods, and dignities ſaved, (as hee himſelfe confeſſed and declared to his ſon and to his friends a little before he ſlew himſelfe;)

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but his heart was ſo ſore ſwolne with glorie and honour, that he loved better to ſlay himſelfe, than to humble himſelfe to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Here behold, how thoſe Paynims aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not to have vertue, but for honour and an outward ſhew: whereas the doctrine of Chriſt teacheth us, To deſire and to luſt after vertues, not only to bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to outward appearance, but alſo to adorne our hearts and our conſciences inwardly therwith, and ſo to pleaſe God. Moreover, alſo we have heretofore ſhewed, That the Chriſtian doctrine comprehendeth much more perfectly, the vertues of good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, than the Paynims doctrine doth. How then dare that filthie <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſay, That men become wicked, like unchained ſlaves, when Oracles failed? where found he this? where ever read hee, that men were worſe, and more evill conditioned in

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the time when Oracles failed, than before? Rather contrarie we reade, That when Oracles failed (which was in the time of the primitive Church) men which gave themſelves to the Chriſtian Religion, were of an holy life and converſation, &amp; they which gave not themſelves to that Religion, but perſevered in their Payniſme, did yet alwayes learne of the Chriſtians that which made them better and of more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Let any reade the workes of <hi>Seneca, Plutarke, Pliny</hi> the Second, and of many <note place="margin">In the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, the Paynims learned of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> other Paynim authors, which were in the time of the primitive Church, and he ſhal find infinit godly and Chriſtian ſentences, which the Paynims learned of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of their time, as may be neceſſarily ſuppoſed. For ſuch ſentences were never borrowed of <hi>Plato, Aristotle,</hi> or of other Philoſophers which were before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of Ieſus Chriſt. As for example, when <hi>Plutarke</hi> diſputerh of the tranquilitie of the ſoule; to flie anger; to ſhun uſurie; of the profit that a man may draw from an enemie; of ſuch as God puniſheth ſlowly, and of many other points, hee uttereth many ſentences, which are truly Chriſtian, and doe hold nothing of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers doctrine, which were before Chriſt our Saviour. And all the workes of <hi>Seneca</hi> are full of Chriſtian ſentences: inſomuch, that many have eſteemed, That <hi>Seneca</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:21818:70"/>
himſelfe was a Chriſtian, yea, that he was well knowne of S. <hi>Paule:</hi> which (it may

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be) was not unworthie to be beleeved. For <hi>Seneca</hi> (who was in the time of <hi>Nero,</hi> and was a learned man, and a lover of the learned) might well have heard <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeake, who at the ſaid time was a priſoner at Rome for the doctrine which hee preached, and might well have beene ſo curious as to talke with him, to underſtand what was that doctrine, whereof all the world ſpoke. But whatſoever it was, none can denie, that the writings of <hi>Seneca</hi> in many places doe not demonſtrate, that hee learned many things of the Chriſtians. Wee may then conclude, That in the time when Oracles failed, and that Chriſtian doctrine began to bee publiſhed and divulged through the world, men became better, and not more wicked, like unchained ſlaves (as this mocker <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith.) For although even in that time, there were found

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> certaine Atheiſts like himſelfe, men muſt not therefore inferre, that all the world, or the moſt part thereof, became wicked. Neither hath <hi>Machiavell</hi> uttered this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as having read it in any good author, but only thereby to blame the Chriſtian Religion, as the cauſe of the corruption of manners. But he impudently lieth, like a ſhameleſſe ſlaunderer, which dare bee ſo bold, as to deliver ſuch talke, without any proofe, and the contrarie whereof is alreadie clearely proved.</p>

Wee reade, That ſhe hath held her ſeat at Avignon, by the ſpace of ſeventie yeares; ſo that by the affluence &amp; plentie of gold and ſilver, which ordinarily arrived there, the towne became ſo opulent &amp; rich, that it yet taſts thereof, and gladly deſireth it might bee alwayes there. As for the Suiffes, of whome <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſpeaketh, I am aſſured, that there are they who would, it coſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> them much money, that the ſeat of the Romane Church were amongſt them: and if it were there, the Pope ſhould not lacke people for his guard; for they would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him of as many as he would, and his Cardinals alſo, for their pay. And I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of that mind, for their entertainement, they would alſo accord them letters to be denizons and free burgeſſes in all their townes, though it bee contrarie to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, to receive ſtrangers. For ſo will they bee glad, that there ſhall every day ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in their countrey plentie of ſilver, which they cannot but love better than either the Popes benedictions or pardons: yet would they alſo be glad to reape their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons at a low price. And notwithſtanding <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, That if the Romane ſeat were there placed, there would be no good peace, for ſowing diviſions amongſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the Suiſſes; that is not likely no more than it ſo did in Avignon, or the countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. For whereas <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith; It ſoweth diviſions and partialities in Italie; that rather happeneth by the humor of that countrey people, which are naturally ſubject to nouriſh diviſions and partialities amongſt both themſelves and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where they have credit; as experience is in Fraunce. Moreover, the Romanes themſelves are not of <hi>Machiavels</hi> opinion, neither doe they complaine, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſeat brings them any domage. At the beginning of that great ſchiſme of Popes, they ſhewed well, how greatly they feared to looſe their ſeat. For ſo much were they afraid, that the Cardinals ſhould againe have a French Pope, which might againe dwell at Avignon, where the ſaid ſeat had ſo long before remained,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that they conſtrained the Cardinals by force, cries, and popularie violence, to elect a Pope of their owne nation: inſomuch, that all through the towne of Rome, and before the place where the Cardinals were aſſembled to make their election, all the people in a mutinie cried with an high voice, <hi>Wee will have a Romane, or at the leaſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Froiſſ. lib,</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</note> 
                     <hi>an Italian.</hi> This was the cauſe that the Cardinals gave them a Romane, whereof the Romane inhabitants were ſo joyous, that they tooke him on their ſhoulders to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him the more, and ſo long and ſo farre carried him through Rome, that they ſtifled him and ſmothered him with the great preaſe amongſt their armes. When they ſaw their terreſtriall god dead, they ſtraight returned to the Cardinals, ſaying their Pope was dead, and they muſt needs give them another. So by their cries and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> popularie tumult, they were conſtrained to give them a new Italian. But after they made another in Avignon, who was Anti-pope to him of Rome: inſomuch, that it may well be ſaid, That too immoderat deſire of the Romans to have the holy ſeat at Rome, was the cauſe of a Papall ſchiſme, which endured nigh fortie yeares, and was the ſpring of many evils.</p>
                  <p>I have before ſaid, and it is true, That the holy ſeat doth more harme far off than
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21818:71"/>
nigh, and it is eaſie to prove by examples. For by tythes, croiſadoes, buls of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> pardons, and other expences, the holy Father, hath ever had cunning enough to draw ſtore of ſilver from farre provinces, as from Fraunce, Almaigne, England, Spaine, and from other where. And all thoſe huge heaps of treaſure, fell in no other place than at Rome and in Italie. So that a good old Civilian Lawyer was wont to ſay: The Court of Rome hath long time had good skill, to change lead into gold: which act, the greateſt Alchymiſts, and the beſt exerciſed Paracelcians of our time could never doe. We alſo ſee the Romanes by the meanes of their bulliſh and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den art, maintaine themſelves brave, fine, and in good order, whereas theſe Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians commonly go all ragged &amp; torne, in great povertie and neceſſitie, having (as they ſay) ſpent their fortunes and patrimonies with blowing the coale, and are of all

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> men a deſpiſed people and of no account.</p>
                  <p>Yet we reade in our hyſtories, That our kings of France have many times hindred Popes to draw ſilver out of the realme, by Annates, Tenthes, Bulles, and other meanes; as in the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, <hi>Benit</hi> the eleventh, <hi>Tulius</hi> the ſecond and third. But concerning this matter, it is good to marke the determination made in <hi>Anno</hi> 1410 by our maſters of the facultie of Sorbone, and by all the Vniverſitie of Paris, which reſolved in a general congregation held at the Bernardines, That the French Church was not bound to pay any ſilver to the Pope in any manner whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unleſſe it be by the way of a charitable ſubſidie, and that in three caſes onely; namely, to employ the ſaid ſilver to the conqueſt of the holy land; for the reunion of <note place="margin">Three caſes into which the Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts doe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the popes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to levie ſilver in France.</note>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Greekes with the Latines; and laſtly, to preach the Goſpell to all creatures. In which caſes only, they ſaid, men ought to furniſh and provide a charitable ſubſidie for the Pope; yet with this condition, That the ſaid Pope touch no ſilver, but that the French Church do appoint and depute treaſurers to diſpend and diſtribute it for the purpoſes aforeſaid, and not otherwiſe. If this magiſtraticall determination were obſerved, verely the Pope would not be contented, but the realme would bee much bettered: and if all Chriſtian princes did agree in the obſervation of this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, certainely, that would come to paſſe which Frier <hi>Iohn</hi> of Rochetaillade prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in his time againſt the Pope. And becauſe his ſermon will not be far from our purpoſe, I will here breefely rehearſe it.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the time that the holy ſeat was at Avignon, about the yeare 1360, there was a Frier minor, called Frier <hi>Iohn de Rochetaillade,</hi> which ſet himſelfe to preach againſt the pride, gourmandizes, and ſuperfluitles of the Pope and his Cardinals, which then were at Avignon, and generally againſt all the prelates and cleargie people, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo againſt princes, which too ſore oppreſſed their ſubjects. Hee alwayes tooke for his text or theme ſome part of the Apocalipſe, and properly applied it to the Pope, Cardinals, and Prelates. Our hyſtoriographers ſay, he was a great clearke, and that he foretold the captivitie of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſixt, being much greeved at his ſermons, cauſed him to be impriſoned, fearing (ſaid hee) that by his great knowledge he cauſed all the world to erre: for that good S. <hi>Peter</hi> was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> That ignorance preſerveth men from erring, and that knowledge brings them into error. And indeed, he that knowes nothing, wherein can he erre? But this good <note place="margin">A ſermon of frier <hi>Iohn de Rochetailiade</hi> againſt the Pope.</note> Frier <hi>Iohn</hi> amongſt other his ſermons, he preached one, which was the cheefe cauſe of his impriſonment, and this was the ſubſtance thereof. <q>Maſters and ladies, I will tell you a ſtrange caſe, which in time paſt of old happened amongſt birds, and it is very like that now we ſee, and hereafter ſhall ſee, the like happen to our holy Father,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21818:72"/>
the Pope. You muſt then underſtand, that in old time a bird was engendred in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> world, which was the faireſt and moſt beautifull to ſee that was poſſible, but it had no feathers. The other birds hearing ſpeake of this featherleſſe bird, thought good to goe ſee it: and being all arrived within the view of her, they found her moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and pitied her, becauſe ſhe could not flie (as they did) for want of feathers. Then held they a Councell, to adviſe what it were beſt to doe, that this goodly bird might not die with hunger, for that ſhee could not flie to get her living. They then reſolved amongſt them, that each bird ſhould give her part of their feathers; which they did, and as ſhe tooke the feathers, ſhe appeared more and more beautifull; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that the other birds gave her ſtill more feathers. As ſoone as this bird ſaw her ſelfe wel emplumed and feathered, and that all the other birds honored her, ſhe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> begun to become fierce and proud, and to deſpiſe the other birds, and yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the ſaid contempt and deſpight, ſhe becked alſo and contraried them in all ſhee could. Then the other birds againe thought it beſt, to aduiſe what was beſt to doe touching this new bird, which they had emplumed, and which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ſtately and inſolent. They concluded in their Counſell, That it were beſt for every one of them to redemaund their feathers, by the meanes of which ſhee was ſo exalted in pride, that ſhe made no account of them. Then all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of birds finding this new bird, after they had ſhewed her the proud incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of her ſelfe, and them, each one tooke his feathers; the Peacocke firſt, the Faulcon after, and all the other birds, ſo that they left her all naked and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> So maſters (ſaid Frier <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Pope and Cardinals) ſhall it happen to you, and doubt not thereof. For when the emperours, kings, and Chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have taken from you the goods and riches that in former times they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, which you beſtow in extreame pride and ſuperfluitie, then ſhall you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine all naked. Where find you, That S. <hi>Peter</hi> or S. <hi>Silvester</hi> rid with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or three hundred horſes? yea, contrarie, their eſtate was very ſimple, encloſed and hid within Rome.</q> Thus Frier <hi>Iohn</hi> preaching, ſpoke but the truth: yet this truth (which is ſo odious to the world) brought him to priſon, where they cauſed him to finiſh his daies. I will then conclude this recitall, That if all Chriſtian princes would practiſe the Magiſtrall determination of our maſters of Sorbonne and of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Vniverſitie of Paris, the ſame would fall unto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> which fell unto Frier <hi>Iohn</hi> his bird.</p>
                  <p>Yet is it not onely by the change of lead into gold, that his Holineſſe dooth <note place="margin">

In the time of the aforeſaid ſchiſme of Popes, hee of Rome, who was called <hi>Vrban,</hi> ſent Buls unto king <hi>Richard</hi> of England (who tooke his part, and was an Vrbaniſt) by which hee commaunded him to make warre upon the king of France, who was a Clementine, and gave him power to levie ſilver upon the <note place="margin">Warre for the Pope of Rome.</note> Engliſh Cleargie. Moreover, hee gave ſo great quantitie of pardons to all them which with a good heart did furniſh ſilver for that warre, that it ſeemed hee meant

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> cleane to have emptied both hell and purgatorie of Engliſhmen: for every man or woman might draw out his father, grandfather, great grandfather, uncles, aunts, children, nephewes, and others aſcendants, deſcendants, and collaterals, by paying ſo much for every poll. He further promiſed their ſoules to be guided right into para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which died in this warre, or which died that yeare after they had paied the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that ſaid warre, nor that there ſhould be any neceſſitie for the ſaid ſoules to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21818:72"/>
ſtray out of their way by purgatorie and the Limbo, but to goe right to paradice.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The ſaid buls being thus preached and publiſhed through England, there was every where a great preaſe, that yeare to die, and to give ſilver, ſo that in a ſmall time there was heaped up the ſumme of 2500000 franks. One part of this ſilver was given to the biſhop of London, who was choſen generall to make warre upon the Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines in Spaine; and the other part was delivered to the biſhop of Norwitch, who was elected generall of another armie to make warre upon France, which alſo was Clementine. And indeed theſe two armies did much harme, as well in Spaine as in France: yet the biſhop of Norwitch being a young man and inconſiderat, entring upon Flaunders an Vrbaniſt, the king of Fraunce, meeting him therewith 100000 men, conſtrained him to retire homeward with ſhame and great loſſe.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the yeare 1513 happened great damage and hurt unto the kings of Fraunce, <note place="margin">Annales up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid yeare. <hi>Du Bellay, lib.</hi> 1. of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories.</note> and of Navarre, by the meanes of an interdict and excommunication which Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond of that name, caſt againſt all the princes which had ſent their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to the counſell of Piſe, whoſe lands and ſeignories he expoſed and gave as a prey to all men that would take and invade them.

And on the other ſide, the king of England fell upon Fraunce (which by the Pope was expoſed as a prey) with an armie of 3000 Engliſh, aſſaying to conquer part thereof. But God ſuffered it not: for in the meane time this wicked Pope died,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and the interdict was revoked, and peace made with the Engliſh. On the other ſide alſo, king <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of Arragon feigning he would come to prey upon France, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the kingdome of Navarre, and got and uſurped it upon king <hi>Iohn d' Albert,</hi>

                  <p>I could here accumulate many other examples, of many great domages &amp; loſſes committed by Popes in ſtrange countries, and even in Almaigne, where they have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> commonly ſowen warres betwixt the emperour and the princes of Almaigne, but I will content my ſelfe with the aboveſaid examples: for I will not at length handle ſuch an ample and almoſt infinit matter: but it ſufficeth mee to have ſhewed, That the contrarie of that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, is true, and that the Pope and his holy ſeat doe much good in the place where they are, and many evils and miſcheefes in farre countries.</p>
                  <p>And as for that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, That Italie is the province of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where there is leaſt Religion, he ſaith very true: but what would hee now ſay, if he were alive: hee ſhould then find, that if in his time they had ſo well profited in his ſchoole, as to be very great Atheiſts and contemners of God and of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that now his ſchollers know farre more than his maſter.

                     <hi>Lawrence de Medicis</hi> (who was cheefe of his houſe) and all his race: and to ſurpriſe him the better, unprovided and without heed taking, they reſolved to ſley and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre him with all his race and ſequele, upon a ſolemne feaſt day, at the houre that the great Maſſe was ſung, and that when the prieſt begun to ſing <hi>Sanctus, Sanctus,</hi> it ſhould be the watch word to ruſh upon them.

                  <p>In concluſion, Italie, Rome, the Pope, and his ſeat, are truly the ſpring and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all deſpight of Religion, and the ſchoole of all impietie: and as they alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die were in <hi>Machiavels</hi> time (as he confeſſeth) ſo are they farre more in this time. For although the papall Church of Rome both heretofore made (and yet dooth) certaine demonſtrations to ſuſtaine a Religion, yet in effect it maintaineth it no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but by ſubtilties and words: for it commaundeth indeed to faſt the vigils and Lent; but is there any place in the world, where they careleſſe for faſting vigils and Lent, than at Rome? It commandeth chaſtitie to prieſts; but is there any place in the world, where prieſts, Cardinals, and others, are more furniſhed with whoores

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and bauds? It alſo commandeth them to ſerve their benefices; but of an hundreth prieſts which are at Rome, there are ſcant one doth it: their Religion forbiddeth the ſale of benefices, ſepulchres, ſacraments, and diſpenſations; but is there any place in the world, where there is a greater trafficke of them, than at Rome? It forbiddeth ſimonie; but where are there any ſimoniakes, if not at Rome and in Italie? I ſpeake onely of the ordinances which the Romane Church hath made, yet her ſelfe doth not obſerve them. For if I would alledge the ordinances of God, which ſhee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no more than the other, I ſhould too tediouſly rehearſe them all. But breefely, the Romane Church hath invented a thouſand traditions, wherewith it hath burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſhoulders of poore Chriſtians to their great abaſhment, but in the meane

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> while the Church it ſelfe will keepe none of them, rather that holy ſeat diſpenſeth with all them of Italie and Rome, and indeed there is no place in the world, where the Popes ordinances are leſſe obſerved, than there, nor where all Religion is in more contempt, as <hi>Machiavell</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth. Let Chriſtians then make their profit of this confeſſion of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> and ſo let them flie the ſpring of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, of Atheiſme, of corruption of manners, and of the contempt of all Religion, leaſt God puniſh them and make them periſh with ſuch wicked men, as make open profeſſion thereof.

                  <p>Yet thinke I good to marke another beaſtlineſſe and ignorance, in that he ſaith, That <hi>Theſeus</hi> came to the domination of Athens, becauſe hee found the eſtate of <note place="margin">Plutarke in Theſ.</note> the Athenians in confuſion: for cleane contrarie he came unto it, becauſe hee was avowed and acknowledged for the ſonne of <hi>Egeus,</hi> king of Athens, and was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly well liked of the Athenians, becauſe hee had acquired the reputation of a magnanimous and valiant man, in that he ſlew and overcame many theeves, which

                  <p>I doubt not but ſome wil judge at the firſt ſight, That this religion of <hi>Numa</hi> could not bee evill, which taught ſo good things; as to obſerve Faith; not to bee perjured, nor to uſurpe others goods and poſſeſſions; but it muſt not be approved therefore: for one muſt not by an evill and falſe, introduce a good thing. This was good, to bring the people to an obſervation of Faith; but to build a temple to Faith, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it was a god, or goddeſſe, and to doe ſervice and ceremonies unto her, theſe were damnable and againſt Gods honour, from whom they ſteale the glory that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs

For that (ſaith he) although their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was falſe, and that they lived in error and darkeneſſe, yet they proſpered, becauſe eſteeming it good and true, they had it in a ſingular reverence and obſervation.

In the yeere 574 after the foundation of Rome, in the time of the conſulſhip of <hi>Lucius Manlius,</hi> and <hi>Fulvius Flaccus</hi> as men digged the earth in a certaine place in Rome, they found the ſepulchre of king <hi>Numa,</hi> where there were two arches of hewen ſtone, in the one of which <hi>Numa</hi> was buried, &amp; in the other were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21818:77"/>
the bookes found which he had written, wrapped in waxe, in ſuch ſort as they ſeemed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to be new, there were ſeven in Latin, touching the ceremonies of the Religion which hee inſtituted. Incontinent a fame went of theſe novels all over, how the bookes of king <hi>Numa</hi> were found touching Religion, inſomuch as every man attended, that they ſhould be divulged, and that by their meanes all abuſes in the Romane Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould alwaies bee reformed. Yet to doe nothing raſhly, the conſuls gave charge to <hi>Quintus Petilius</hi> lieutenant of juſtice, well to turne over, and peruſe thoſe bookes, and to report the truth of them unto the Senat. <hi>Petilius</hi> read them from the one end unto the other, and of them certified his opinion unto the Senat: and it was found, that the Religion which was handled in thoſe bookes, was of no accompt, and that it ſhould bee a pernitious and damageable thing to the common wealth, to bring that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Religion into uſe: ſo was it reſolved by a decree of the Senat, that thoſe books ſhould bee publiklie burnt before all the people, which was done. I would now gladly know of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> who ſo much eſteemeth the Religion of <hi>Numa,</hi> without ever having ſeene his bookes, if hee can yeeld a better jugdment of them than the Lieutenant <hi>Petilius,</hi> who read them, and than all the Romane Senat.

                  <p>As for Frier <hi>Ierome Savanarola</hi> the Florentins ſhewed well, that hee was no ſuch <note place="margin">De com. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. 53. 54.</note> man as would leade them to any new Religion, neither preached hee unto them any other Religion, but the old Romiſh Religion, only denouncing unto them ſomtime the vengeances &amp; puniſhments of God, which from heaven ſhould fall upon them,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> if they repented and amended not their ſinnes, and this hee aſſured them as though hee had had ſome revelation from God. But amongſt other things which hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and affirmed moſt, was, that there ſhould come a king out of France into I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie, which ſhould deliver the countrey from ſo many tyranizers and potentates, as then held the countrey in great ſervage and ſlaverie. This talke pleaſed ſome which deſired change, though others delighted not in it. About the time that hee made thoſe ſermons, king <hi>Charles</hi> the eight made a voiage unto Naples, who aſſoone as hee was ſeene in Italie, all the world began to ſay, and beleeve that Frier <hi>Ierome</hi> was a true prophet, and that hee had well foretould, that which they ſee come to paſſe. The worſt was, that the ſaid king did nothing worthie of accompt in the voiage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that the beſt part of <hi>Ieromes</hi> propheſie (which was to purge Italie of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tyranizers) remained yet to accompliſh. Then the reputation of this good Frier <hi>Ierome,</hi> began not onely to diminiſh, but alſo men began to ſay and beleeve that hee was an abuſer; ſo that in the end hee was accuſed at Florence, to be a moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heretike; and his enemies ſaid, hee were worthie to bee put into a ſacke and to be caſt into the river: and becauſe hee ſtill continued to preach his firſt theme; That the king of France ſhould yet againe come into Italie, to performe that which he had not executed in that firſt voiage, and that the will of God was ſo, and if hee did not accompliſh it, yet God himſelfe would puniſh it<hi>:</hi> the Pope and the Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> which were hereat troubled, for they thought this was but a bait to cauſe the king of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> France to come another time into Italie, where of they were greatlie afraid, therefore ioyned they together againſt this poore Frier, and writ to the ſeignorie of Florence, to doe juſtice upon him as upon a ſeducer and an heretike.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt others which tooke <hi>Ierome</hi> in hand there was found a Frier (for there never was love betwixt the Friers, and the Iacobines) which would needes maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">A diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Fire.</note> againſt him, that hee was an heretike, and to prove his ſo ſaying, he preſented
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21818:77"/>
unto <hi>Ierome</hi> the combat, to commit themſelves both into the fire, and that hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which was not hurt by the fire, ſhould be held (as it was reaſon) for a soothſayer, and the other whom the fire burned, for a lyer and an abuſer. Frier <hi>Ierome</hi> was ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed to heare ſpeake of ſuch a manner of diſputation, and indeed would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it: for he was not ſo learned not ſo farre a ſtudent in Logicke, that he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch a kind of argumentation, to prove his doctrine by fire: yet was there found another young Iacobin, a familiar friend of <hi>Ieromes,</hi> which accepted the combat, to maintaine his friends quarrell. Then was the day and place aſſigned in the towne of Florence, for thoſe two valiant combattants, both of them to place themſelves upon a great heape of faggots, which were laid to that end, for to ſet fire thereunto as ſoone as they came upon them. The day aſſigned being come, behold the two

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> combattants appeared: but the <hi>Iacobin</hi> had about him (as they call it) the precious bodie of the Hoſt for his defence, which he tooke betwixt both his hands: the Frier and the Seignorie ſhewed, That that was no reaſonable defence for the Iacobin, and therefore urged him to let goe the Hoſt: but hee would not for any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it: inſomuch, as by that meanes the combat ended, and each one which came to that place to ſee thoſe valiant combattants goe to the fire, returned to their houſes. But not long after they were all three endighted, and I know not how nor wherefore, they were accuſed and condemned (for I finde nothing written thereof) but they were all three burnt. Here behold how the Florentines handled this poore Frier <hi>Ierome,</hi> whom <hi>Machiavell</hi> reports to have ſpoken with God. It may be, ſome

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at the beginning had ſome good opinion of him; but in the end, they made him well know, that he was no ſuch able man, to perſuade them either to the Religion of <hi>Numa,</hi> or to any other Religion: for the moſt part of them cared for neither the one nor the other.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that which the poets writ for fables concerning Fortune, is the very truth. For the Paynim poets have written, That Fortune is a goddeſſe, who giveth good and evill things to whom ſhe liſt. And to denote, that this ſhee doth inconſiderately and without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they wrap her head in a cloth, leaſt with her eyes ſhe ſee, and know to whom ſhe giveth; ſo that ſhe never knoweth unto whom ſhe doth good or evill: moreover, they deſcribe her ſtanding upright upon a boule, to denote her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie and unſtaiedneſſe, turning and toſſing, one while on the one ſide, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while on the other. Now <hi>Machiavell</hi> would make men beleeve, that this is true,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and that all the good and evill which comes to men, happeneth, becauſe they have Fortune accordant or diſcordant to their complexions. Hee after ſayth; That ſhee commonly favoureth young people, ſuch as are hazardous and inconſiderate; to the end, that therby men might learne that rule, to be raſh, violent, and headie, that they may have Fortune favourable unto them. But all this doctrine tends to the ſame end as the former Maximes doe, namely, to inſinuate into mens minds and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21818:78"/>
hearts a deſpight and utter contempt of God and his providence. For let man have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> once this perſuaſion; That no good comes unto us from God, but from Fortune; he will eaſily forſake the ſervice of God: as alſo when men beleeve, that evill (that is to ſay, the puniſhments of vices and ſinnes) come not from the juſt judgement of God, but onely from Fortune, which inconſiderately and raſhly gives evils without conſideration, whether they merit them, or no, and as ſoone to the good as to the wicked; then need we not doubt, but ſtraight ſuch a man is emptied of all feare of God, and readie to fall into every vice.

                  <p>But againſt this we have good preſervatives drawne out of the holy Scriptures,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whereby we are aſſured, That nothing fals to us, but by Gods providence, and that ſuch afflictions as are ſent us, are for our good, leaſt the ſlipperie way of proſperitie make us fall, to our deſtruction: inſomuch, as wee praiſe God for both good and evill; reſolving our ſelves, that that which unto our carnall ſences appeareth to bee evill, is not evill to our ſoules, but very healthfull and good, becauſe there is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Maxime, That no evill can happen to a Chriſtian, from the hand of God our Father: but my purpoſe is not here to handle that point of Theologie any further, but I will confute <hi>Machiavell,</hi> even by the Paynims themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I oppoſe againſt him almoſt all the auncient Philoſophers, which have maintained, That nothing happeneth, nor is done, without ſome efficient cauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to us it be unknowne. True it is, that they make a diſtinction of cauſes: for they ſay, that God is the firſt cauſe, which holds in action all other inferior cauſes; <note place="margin">God is the firſt cauſe of all things.</note> which they call Second, and makes them worke their effects: and although often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in this diſtinction of cauſes, they attribute ſome things to ſecond cauſes, which they ſhould attribute to the firſt alone, yet notwithſtanding, they referre all things to God mediately or immediately. Very true it is, that ſometimes they uſe that name of Fortune, applying themſelves to the manner of ſpeech uſed amongſt the people; but there was never Philoſopher ſo beaſtly, that ever thought her to be any goddeſſe: but when the auncient Philoſophers ſay any thing comes by fortune, or by adventure, or contingencie; they meane, that the efficient cauſe of ſuch a thing

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is unknowne: for that is their doctrine and manner of ſpeech, to ſay, that a thing happeneth or chanceth by Fortune, and contingently, when they know not the cauſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>Learnedly ſpeakes <hi>Plutarke</hi> to this purpoſe, when he ſayth; That the poets have <note place="margin">Plutarke in libello de For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna.</note> done great wrong to Fortune, to ſay, ſhe is blind, and that ſhe gives her gifts to men raſhly without knowing them: for (ſayth he) it is we which know it not: for Fortune is no other thing but the cauſe (whereof we are ignorant) of things which wee ſee come to paſſe. And therfore the Stoicke philoſophers, although they knew not the ſecond cauſes of all things, no more than other philoſophers, yet uſed they another manner of ſpeech than they, and attributed the haps and chances of all things unto

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the ordinance and providence of God, which they called by the name of <hi>Fatum:</hi> yet indeed the <hi>Fatum</hi> differeth much from the providence of God, which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hold.

                  </gap>are to ſuch as would ſhew him the truth, and to diſpoile himſelfe of all pietie, conſcience, and religion. There remaines now to handle the third part of his ſaid doctrine, which concerneth Pollicie, whereof there are many parts, for in it are comprehended ſuch Maximes, as concerne Peace, War, Faith, Promiſe, Oth, Clemencie, Crueltie, Liberalitie, Covetouſneſſe, Conſtancie, Craft, Iuſtice, and other vertues and vices, conſiderable in publike and politike perſons. All theſe things <hi>Machiavell</hi> handles in ſuch ſort, as it is eaſie to know, that his onely purpoſe was to inſtruct a prince to bee a true tyrant, and to teach him the art of tyrannie. In

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which art, verily hee hath ſhewed himſelfe a great doctor, yea far greater than <hi>Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:</hi> for <hi>Bartolus,</hi> (who was a renowmed doctor in the civile law) in his treatiſe written of tyrannie, wades no thing ſo deepe in the matter as <hi>Machiavell</hi> doth, although reading the treatiſe of <hi>Bartolus,</hi> it ſeemes that <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath learned a great deale of his knowledge: but <hi>Machiavell</hi> applieth it contrary, ſeeking, that men ſhould hold it for good, whereas <hi>Bartolus</hi> ſpeaketh of it as of a damnable thing, which men ought to repulſe and ſhun with all their power: and to conferre a little thereupon, I will here ſummarily recite certaine points of doctor <hi>Bartolus,</hi> touching this matter of tyrannie, to ſhew that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath ſtolne, yet would applie it to the dutie of a prince, whereas <hi>Bartolus</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth it to the iniquitie and mallice of a tyrant. Firſt <hi>Bartolus</hi> conſtituteth two kinds

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of tyrants, the one in title, the other in exerciſe. A tyrant in title (ſaith he) is hee which without any title, or els with a bad title uſurpeth a domination and ſeignorie: A tirant in exerciſe is hee, who having a lawfull title to dominier and rule, ruleth not iuſtly and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie as a good prince ought to doe: after this hee numbreth ten ſorts of actions, whereby a tyrant is manifeſted to be a tyrant in exerciſe. The firſt action is, when he puts to death the mightieſt and moſt excellent perſons amongst his ſubiects, for feare they ſhould ariſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21818:80"/>
against his tyrannie. The ſecond, when he troubleth and afflicteth good and wiſe men of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his domination, leaſt they ſhould diſcover his vices to the people. The third action, when he ſeekes to aboliſh ſtudies and good letters, to the end wiſdome may not be learned. The fourth, when he forbiddeth lawfull and honeſt aſſemblies and congregations, fearing men will ariſe up againſt him. The fift, when hee hath ſpies in all places, fearing men ſpeake evill of his evill actions. The ſixt, when hee maintaines diviſions amongst his ſubiects, to the end, one part may feare another, and ſo neither the one nor the other ariſe against him. The ſeventh, when he ſeekes to hold his ſubiects poore, to the end, that they being occupied in the meanes to get their living, they may machinate nothing against him. The eight, when he ſeekes to maintaine warre to effeebliſh his ſubiects, and to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſtudies, and to make himſelfe ſtrong, when he needs. The ninth, when hee trusteth

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> more in ſtrangers than in his owne ſubiects, and that he be takes himſelfe unto a ſtrange guard. And the tenth action is, when there is partialitie amongst his ſubiects, and he adhereth more to the one than the other. Which tenne kinds of action, <hi>Bartolus</hi> proveth by reaſons of law to be truly tyrannicall, by which a tyrant in exerciſe is known and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested to be a tyrant, and eſpecially (ſayth he) by theſe three kinds; when hee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth diviſion amongst his ſubiects; when he empoveriſheth them; and when he afflicteth them in their perſons and goods, inſomuch, that the moſt part of the people are miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. And finally, he concludeth, That to ſuch tyrants by right and reaſon men ought not to obey nor appeare before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that they ought to be diſpoſſeſſed of their eſtates. But in all this doctrine of <hi>Bartolus</hi> can you find one onely point, that <hi>Machiavell</hi> would

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not have applied and taught to a prince? All theſe tenne kinds of tyrannicall actions, ſet down by <hi>Bartolus,</hi> are they not ſo many Maximes of <hi>Machiavell</hi> his doctrine taught to a prince? Saith he not? That a prince ought to take away all vertuous people, lovers of their commonwealth, to maintain partialities and diviſions, to impoveriſh his ſubiects, to nouriſh warres, and to doe all other the aforeſaid things, which <hi>Bartolus</hi> ſaith to bee the works of tyrants. We need then no more to doubt, that the purpoſe of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> was not to forme a true tyrant; and that hee hath not ſtolne from <hi>Bartolus,</hi> one part of his tyrannicall doctrine which he teacheth, which yet he hath much augmented and enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For he hath added, That a prince ought to governe himſelfe by his owne counſell; and he ought not to ſuffer any to diſcover unto him the truth of things; and that hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ought not to care for any Religion (as we have ſhewed before) neither that he ought to obſerve any faith or oth, but ought to be cruell, a deceiver, a fox in craftineſſe, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, inconstant, unmercifull, and perfectly wicked, if it be poſsible, as we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. So that hereby apparently may be ſeene, That <hi>Machiavell</hi> is a farre greater do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the art of tyrannie, than <hi>Bartolus;</hi> yet I compare them not together: For that which <hi>Bartolus</hi> hath written of tyrannie, was to diſcover and condemne it: but that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath written, was to cauſe princes to practiſe and obſerve it, and to ſow in their hearts a true tyrannicall poyſon, under the pretext and name of a princes dutie and office. Finally, there is no cauſe nor reaſon to compare this beastly <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi> a ſimple burne-paper-ſcribe of the towne-houſe of Florence, with this great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

And therefore to ſay, that the magnificent <hi>Laurence de Medicis,</hi> had juſt occaſion to get Italie, to deliver it from the evill handling of the potentates thereof, which there dominiered and ruled, this in no ſort could bee called a juſt cauſe of warr; but it rather may be called an evill againſt an evill, and tyrannie againſt tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, becauſe they <hi>de Medicis</hi> cannot ſay, that they have any right or title unto Italie.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But if wee conſider what tyrannie is, as the elders have ſpoken thereof, we ſhall find, that not onely men in old time called ſuch princes tyrants, which handled evill and rudely their ſubjects, as <hi>Caligula, Nero, Commodus,</hi> &amp; other like; but alſo ſuch as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led well and kindlie their ſubjects, when without title they uſurped domination upon them, as <hi>Iulius Ceſar, Hieron</hi> of <hi>Siracuſe,</hi> the governours which the Lacedaemonians ſet over Athens, and other like.

But they could never obtaine other thing, at the Romane Senates hand for theſe allegations, but that the Senate ſent embaſſadours to the Samnites, to pray them to ceaſe making warre upon the Campanians, the Romanes neighbours: Then the Campanians deputies ſaid: <q>Well (my maſters) ſeeing you will not now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us, againſt an unjuſt &amp; tyrannous invaſion, yet at the leaſt defend that which is your owne, for wee yeeld and give our ſelves to you, yea us and all that is ours:</q> Then the Senate, taking title and foundation of this dedition, enterpriſed the defence of

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21818:82"/>
conſider and examine, if therein there bee juſt cauſe, or no: for warres are eaſie to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> commence (as <hi>M. Comines</hi> ſayth) but very uneaſie to appeaſe and finiſh. And upon this we reade, That in the Senate of Rome there was once a very notable diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene <hi>Cato</hi> (one eſteemed the wiſeſt of Rome) and <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> (who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the beſt man of Rome.) The matter was this: After the firſt Punicke warre, the Romanes made peace with the Carthaginians, by which peace was accorded, That the Carthaginians might not rig any ſhip of warre, nor moove warre againſt the Romanes or their allies. It came to paſſe a certaine time after this peace, that the Carthaginians gathered together many ſhips: which being reported at Rome, and the matter propounded in counſell in the Senate, <hi>Cato</hi> and many others reaſoned, That warre ſhould be made upon the Carthaginians, becauſe they had gone from the treatie of peace, and that warre might juſtly be offered unto them, as breakers of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> peace. But <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> was of a contrarie opinion, That there was yet no ſufficient cauſe to make warre: for although the Carthaginians had gone againſt the peace, and violated their faith and promiſe; yet the Romanes received no offence or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage as yet: and therefore he was of advice, That the Carthaginians ſhould bee ſummoned to lay downe their armes, and untackle their ſhips, and obſerve peace, even in the articles which they had broken. The pluralitie of voices were of <hi>Naſica</hi> his opinion, and accordingly, men were ſent to Carthage to ſummon them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate and obey the treatie of peace, and to repaire contraventions. They would doe nothing therein, but prepared themſelves more to ſet upon <hi>Maſsiniſſa</hi> their allie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and friend. Then (this comming to counſell in the Senate) all agreed, That then there was juſt cauſe to move warre againſt the Carthaginians, ſeeing they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die begun to practiſe the ſame againſt <hi>Maſsiniſſa,</hi> their allie and friend: but there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were diverſe opinions, whether they ſhould altogether ruinate from the top to the bottome the towne of Carthage, after they had taken it, or to let it ſtill remaine a towne. <hi>Cato</hi> was of opinion, totally to ruinate and deſtroy it; becauſe it could not be kept in any fidelitie, but would breake her faith and promiſe at the firſt occaſion that offered it ſelfe. <hi>Naſica</hi> was of a contrarie advice, ſaying, It was good that Rome had alwayes an enemie, upon whom to make warre, that the Romane people might not be corrupt, and become cowards by too great peace and proſperitie, for want upon

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> whom to make warre. The reſolution of the Senat was in a meane betwixt theſe two opinions. For it was ordained, That the Carthaginians ſhould be permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their towne into any other part tenne mile from the ſea. But the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans found ſo ſtrange the removing of their towne, that they had rather ſuffer all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame things: inſomuch, as by long warre they were wholly vanquiſhed, and their towne altogether raſed and made inhabitable.</p>
                  <p>Very memorable alſo to this purpoſe is the advice of the Chancellor <hi>de</hi> Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <note place="margin">Annales up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the year 1488.</note> who was in the time of king <hi>Charles</hi> the eight.

According to this advice, embaſſadors were ſent to the duke, who then was at Reves, to ſend on his ſide, men of counſell, and the king would doe ſo on his ſide, to reſolve upon both their rights.

After they had (as they thought) well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved him of this point, yet he was not content to be ſatisfied himſelfe, but would, that his ſubjects ſhould be alſo well reſolved thereof, and eſpecially ſuch as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Engliſh obedience: and to that purpoſe hee ſent preachers covertly into ſuch good townes as were occupied by the Engliſh; inſomuch, that readily by the preachers inducements there were more than threeſcore townes and fortreſſes, which revolted from the Engliſhmen, and offered themſelves unto the kings obeiſance.

But here may ariſe a queſtion, if it be lawfull for a prince to make war for religion, and to conſtraine men to bee of his religion? hereupon to take the thing by reaſon, the reſolution is very eaſie: For ſeeing that all religion conſiſteth in an approbation of certaine points that concerne the ſervice of God, certaine it is, that ſuch an approbation dependeth upon the perſuaſion which is given to men thereof: but the meanes to perſuade a thing to any man, is not to take weapons, to bear him, nor to menace him, but to demonſtrate unto him by good reaſons and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, which may induce him to a perſuaſion. But he that will decide this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by examples of our aunceſtors, he ſhall find divers to be for and againſt. For to reade our French hyſtories in the lives of <hi>Clowis</hi> the firſt, <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kings of Fraunce, it ſeemeth that their ſtudie was altogether bent upon warre <note place="margin">Annales up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Anno</hi> 718.</note> againſt Paynims, for nothing, but to make them become Chriſtians, with hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowes and force of armes. But what Chriſtians? That is when the Paynims were vanquiſhed, and that they could no more reſiſt, they were acquited upon condition
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21818:83"/>
to be baptized without other inſtruction. And moſt commonly, as ſoone as they

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> could againe gather ſtrength, they returned to their Paynim religion. And this is well ſhewed us by the hyſtorie of one <hi>Rabbod,</hi> duke of Fricſe, who being upon the point to be baptized, and his clothes off, and having one foot in the font, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the archbiſhop of Sens, which ſhould have baptized him, Whether there were more of his parents in hell or in paradice? The archbiſhop aunſwered him, that the moſt muſt needs be in hell, becauſe his predeceſſors were never bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Then the duke drawing his foot out of the water: Well, ſaid he then, I will goe to hell with my parents and friends, and I will not be baptized, to be ſeperated from them, &amp; ſo he withdrew himſelfe, denying to be baptized. Here I leave you to thinke if this man were well inſtructed in the Chriſtian doctrine. It ſeemeth, that at that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> day, to be a Chriſtian, it ſufficed to be baptized, and commonly Paynims were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by force of armes.</p>
                  <p>We reade alſo, That our auncient kings of Fraunce made many voyages into Turkie and into Affrica for the augmentation of the Chriſtian Religion, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge (as they ſaid) the death of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt upon the Paynims and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. But one time the Paynims themſelves ſhewed them well, that they enterpriſed ſuch warres by an inconſiderate zeale. For the armie of Fraunce (whereof the duke of Bourbon was cheefe) being in Affrica, making warre againſt the Infidels, in the time of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, the captaine generall of the Turkes and Saracens ſent an herauld to the duke of Bourbon, to know wherefore he diſcended into Affrica to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> make warre upon them. The duke of Bourbon aſſembled the greateſt lords of the armie to reſolve what anſwer to make to the herauld. After, by the advice of all, it was anſwered, That they Chriſtians made warre upon them, to revenge the death of Chriſt the ſonne of God, and a true Prophet, which their generation had put to death and crucified. The Turkes underſtanding this anſwere, ſent againe to the duke of Bourbon, and the lords of France, that they had by ſome received evill informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon that matter, for they were the Iewes which crucified Ieſus Chriſt, and not their predeceſſors: and if the children muſt needs ſuffer for their aunceſtors faults, they ſhould then take the Iewes, which were then amongſt them, and upon them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the death of their Ieſus Chriſt. Our Frenchmen knew not what to anſwere

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> hereunto, yet they continued the warre, where was done no notable exploit, but by contagion of the aire they were conſtrained to returne, after they had loſt the moſt part of their armie.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, in the yeare 1453 the Pope having proclaimed a Croiſado in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to run over Turkie, to avenge the death of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the Turkes to be chriſtened: the Turke writ letters unto him; wherein he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that they were the Iewes which crucified Chriſt. And as for him, hee deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not of the Iewes, but of the Trojans blood, whereof hee underſtood the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were likewiſe deſcended. And that their dutie were rather, both one of us, and the other to reſtore rather the great Troy, and to revenge the death of <hi>Hector</hi> their

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> aunceſtor, againſt the Grecians, than to make warre one upon another, as for his part he was readie to doe, having alreadie ſubjugated the moſt part of Greece. And that he beleeved, that Ieſus Chriſt was a great Prophet, but that he never comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as he was given to underſtand) that men ſhould beleeve in his law by force and by armes: as alſo on his part, he ſo conſtrained no man to beleeve in the law of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi> Behold the ſubſtance of the Turkes letter to the Pope, which ſeemed to bee
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21818:83"/>
as wel, yea, better founded upon reaſons than the Popes buls. For verily Ieſus Chriſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> would, that by preaching, his law ſhould be received into the world, and not by force of armes.</p>
                  <p>In the time when Chriſtendome was devided into Clementines and Vrbaniſts, by reaſon of a ſchiſme of Popes, we may well preſuppoſe, that the one thought the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Froiſar. lib.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 132. 133 <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap</hi> 24.</note> other to be altogether out of the way of ſalvation: and our hyſtorians ſay, That the one part called the other dogs, miſcreants, infidels, &amp;c. Their reaſon was, becauſe they ſaid, that as there was but one God in heaven, ſo there ought to bee but one on earth: and the aforeſaid Clementines held aſſuredly, That Pope <hi>Clement</hi> was the true god on earth, and Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> the falſe god, and that the Vrbaniſts beleeved in a falſe god, and by conſequent that they all ſtrayed from the faith. For as no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> can ſtand without beleeving in God, ſo eſteemed they, that they which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not in the true earthly god, were altogether without all religion, as dogs &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants: &amp; our hyſtoriographers, which held that opinion as well as the other, ſaid, That from that time the faith was ſhaken and readie to fall to the ground. The ſame opinion had the Vrbaniſts of the Clementines, as the Clementines had of the Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baniſts. We have before in another place, ſaid, That under colour of this diverſitie in religion, the king of England, who was an Vrbaniſt, enterpriſed to make warre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the kings of France and Caſtile, Clementines. Likewiſe alſo the Clementines enterpriſed no leſſe againſt the Vrbaniſts, yea, againſt the Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> himſelfe, whom they beſieged in the towne of Peronſe, where he was in great danger to have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> been taken, yet in the end he ſaved himſelfe at Rome. The king of Fraunce determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have paſſed into Italie, by warre to have deſtroyed the Vrbaniſts; but in the end he tooke another reſolution, which was to cauſe the ſchiſme to ceaſe: ſo he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to convocate a great and notable aſſembly in the towne of Rhemes in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne, whither in perſon reſorted the emperour <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> and there a concluſion was made to exhort the two Popes to ſubmit themſelves to the new election of a Pope, wherein their right ſhould bee conſerved unto them: and if they would not ſubmit themſelves thereunto, that the Chriſtian princes and their ſubjects ſhould withdraw themſelves from the obedience both of the one and the other. After this ſubtraction was made (becauſe the ſaid Popes would not obey the exhortation that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was made) there was a new election of a Pope (in a Counſell held at Piſe by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and the kings authorities) called Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the fift, a Frier minor, and the other two Antipopes were curſed, as is ſaid in another place. And thus ceaſed the warres for Religion in all Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe alſo you muſt know, That during the ſaid ſchiſme of the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentines <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Froiſar. lib.</hi> 4 <hi>cap.</hi> 33.</note> and Vrbaniſts, the duke of Bretaigne had peace with the king of Fraunce, and a great aſſembly was made betwixt them in the towne of Tours. The duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing there, ſome of the kings Counſell ſhewed him, that hee was diſobedient to the king, being of another religion than the king was (for the king was a Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and the duke an Vrbaniſt) and it was not meet that the vaſſale ſhould be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> religion than his ſoveraigne lord. The aboveſaid duke aunſwered wiſely, That it could not bee called a rebellion or diſobedience: for no man ought to judge of his conſcience, but only God, who is the ſoveraigne and only judge of ſuch a matter, and that he beleeved in Pope <hi>Vrban,</hi> becauſe his election was before Pope <hi>Clements.</hi> Some of the kings Counſell, of the meaneſt ſort, made a great matter of this diverſitie of religion: but the dukes of Berry and Bourgoigne, the kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21818:84"/>
were opinioned, that it was not a ſufficient point to ſtand upon, to put by, an

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> accord with the duke of Bretaigne: inſomuch, that following their advice, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord was concluded, yea, a mariage of one of the kings daughters with the ſaid duke of Bretaigne.</p>
                  <p>This example and advice of theſe two good dukes, mee thinkes all Chriſtian princes ſhould follow, and not ceaſe to agree together for diverſitie of Religion, but to remit the judgement thereof unto God, who alone can compound and agree the differences of the ſame. And not onely amongſt princes the bond of amitie ought not to bee broken, for difference of Religion: but alſo princes ought not to uſe armes againſt their ſubjects, to force them unto a Religion, but they ought to aſſay all other meanes, to demonſtrate unto them by lively reaſons their errors, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſo bring them to a good way: and if it appeare not that their ſubjects doe erre and ſtray, they ought to maintaine them, and not perſecute them, at the inſtigation of flatterers and envious people. An example hereof is memorable of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, who was called the Father of the people. For in his time certaine Cardinals and Prelates perſuaded him to exterminate and utterly to root out all the people of Cabriers and Merindol in Provence (which were the reliques of the Chriſtians, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Albi, then ſore perſecuted for Chriſt) telling him, That they were ſorcerers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous <note place="margin">

They of Merindol and Cabriers having ſome ſente of the aforeſaid accuſation, ſent certaine of their wiſeſt men to remonſtrate to the king their juſtice and innocencie. As ſoone as theſe men were arrived at the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Court, the ſaid Cardinals and Prelates did what they could to hinder, that they ſhould not be heard, and indeed told the king, that he ought not to heare them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cannon law holds, That men ought not to give audience to heretickes, nor communicate with them. The king replied, That if he had to make warre upon the Turke, yea, againſt the divell himſelfe, he would heare them. This was an anſwere worthie of a king. For ſeeing kings hold in their hands the ſcepter of juſtice, this is not to uſe, but to abuſe, To condemne any, &amp; not to heare them. The ſaid king <hi>Lewis</hi> then hearing the ſaid meſſengers of Cabriers and Merindol, they ſhewed him in all humilitie, that their people received the Goſpell, the Bible, &amp; the Apoſtles Creed, the commaundements of God, and the Sacraments, but they beleeved not in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Pope nor in his doctrine: and that if it pleaſed his Majeſtie to ſend to enquire of the truth of their ſpeeches, they were contented all to die, if their words were not found true. This good king would needs know if it were ſo, and indeed deputed <hi>M. Adam Fumee,</hi> his maſter of Requeſts, and one <hi>M. Parvi,</hi> a Iacobin, his Confeſſor, to go to Cabriers and Merindol, to enquire of the life and religion of the inhabitants in thoſe places; which they did: and after they had ſeene and knowne all, they made their report unto the king, That in thoſe places their children were baptized, they taught them the articles of the Faith, and the commandements of God; that they well obſerved their Sabboths, alwayes preaching thereon the word of God: and as for ſorceries and whoredomes, there were none amongſt them: moreover, they

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> found no images in their temples, nor ornaments of the Maſſe. The king having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this report, what judgement gave he of it? did hee condemne them ſtraight, becauſe they had no images nor ornaments of the Maſſe? No, he preſently ſwearing by his oth, pronounced, That they were better men than he or all his people. Here may princes learne how to uſe themſelves, in ſupporting againſt ſlanderers, ſuch, in whom there is no appearance of error.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:21818:84"/>
But leaving this queſtion, and againe taking our purpoſe: certaine it is, That a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> prince ought not lightly to attempt warre (as <hi>Machiavell</hi> perſuadeth) and upon <note place="margin">A prince ought to ſeeke all meanes to put out war by a peace.</note> ſome neceſſitie, having warre in hand, he ought to ſearch out and accept all honeſt conditions to get out of it. For ſometimes the prince which refuſeth honeſt and reaſonable conditions, upon hope that his forces are great, falleth oftentimes into great diſtreſſe: and it hath been many times ſeene, that pettie captaines have made head againſt great and ſtrong powers of mightie princes.</p>
                  <p>In the time of the battaile of Poictiers, where king <hi>Iohn</hi> was taken, the prince of Wales before the battaile, offered the king to yeeld him all that both hee and his <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Froiſar. lib.</hi> 1 <hi>cap</hi> 161.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and foure of the greateſt lords of the armie, ſhould yeeld themſelves at his will. The prince (who was generous) choſe rather to fight it out, than to accept ſo ſhamefull and diſhonorable an accord; ſo hee and his army fought valiantly, inſomuch that a very little numbar of Engliſh, overcame great forces of the French, and the king was taken, and many other great princes and lords, for which to redeeme, the kingdome was ſo emptied of ſilver, that they were compelled to make money of leather, which in the middeſt had onely a note of ſiluer: and from this battaile proceeded infinite evils, miſeries, and calamities, which had not happened if the king had beene ſo well adviſed, as to have forgone that war by ſoft and aſſured meanes, rather than by the hazard of the battaile. But contrary to king <hi>Iohn,</hi> king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeaventh, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Guienne and Normandie upon the Engliſh, never refuſed any proffer or compoſition, ſought alwaies to recover that which his predeceſſors had juſtly loſt, without effuſion of bloud.</p>
                  <p>The Romane hyſtories are ful of ſuch like examples: For that which overthrew the Carthaginians, the king <hi>Perſeus,</hi> the king <hi>Mithridates;</hi> that which abated the pride of <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>Macedon,</hi> of that great king <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and of many others, was, they could never accept the good and reaſonable conditions, of peace which was offered unto them by the Romanes, but would rather experiment, what force, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a good right could doe; I ſay founded upon good right, becauſe a ſmall force which hath right with it, oftentimes abateth a great force, which is not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> on a good right: the reaſon is evident, becauſe, hee that knoweth hee hath juſt cauſe to make warre, and which ſeeth that his adverſary, truſting much in his forces, will not come to any reaſonable compoſition, redoubleth his courage, his heat, and fighteth more valiantlie, than hee which is driven thereunto, rather upon pride than of any generoſitie of heart; but the principall reaſon thereof is, that God who giveth victories, inclineth moſt often to the rights ſide, and although ſometimes it ſeemes that the wrong carrieth away the victorie, yet alwaies God ſhewes by the end &amp; iſſue, (according to which we muſt judge) that hee is fot the right.</p>
                  <p>Above all, the prince ought to appeaſe the warres in his owne countrey, whether <note place="margin">A prince ought to appeaſe war in his owne countrey.</note> they be raiſed by ſtrangers, or by his owne ſubjects, for, as for ſuch warres, as he may have in a ſtrange land, againſt ſtrangers it may happen they will not prove ſo evill,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but hee may provide good ſouldiers in his neede: and eſpeciallie this point is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, when a princes ſubjects are naturallie enclined to warre (as is the French nation) for then neceſſarily, they muſt bee emploied in that wherein is their naturall diſpoſition, or els they will move war againſt themſelves, as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith in theſe words, If (ſaith hee) the vertue and generoſitie of princes, captaines, and men of warre,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21818:85"/>
might ſo well be emploied, and ſhew it ſelfe of ſuch eſtimate in peace as in warre, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> things would carry themſelves more conſtantly, and men ſhould not ſee ſuch changes of one eſtate into another, nor all thing mixed in a confuſion as wee ſee. Therefore a ſtrange warre in a ſtrange country, ſeemeth not to be very damageable, but ſomething neceſſary, to occupie and exerciſe his ſubjects, but domeſticke and civill wars, muſt needes be ſhunned and extinguiſhed with all our power, for they be things againſt the right of nature, to make war againſt the people of their countrey, as he that doth it againſt his owne entrails: Therefore ſaith <hi>Homer:</hi>

                  <p>The prince alſo ought to conſider, that by civile warres, he more weakeneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his ſubjects in one yeere, than by a ſtrange warre he can do in thirtie yeeres: civile warres alſo are without compariſon, more ruinous and dangerous than ſtrange warres are.</p>

                  <p>Although the horrors and calamities of civile warres are ſufficiently knowne in this time, yet will I breefely rehearſe two moſt notable examples. The civile warre

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which was in the Romane empire, betwixt <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla,</hi> was an horrible and fearefull butcherie, which filled Rome and all Italie with blood. For both of them were maſters of Rome and all Italie, one after another; and ſo being, they did not ceaſe all they could to kill and maſſacre one anothers friends and partakers: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that in a manner all men of qualitie and all good people were ſlain: for there was no notable man, but he held of the one or the other. Amongſt other memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things happening in this warre, this eſpecially concerneth our cauſe in hand, which fell in the battaile that <hi>Pompeius</hi> the lieutenant of <hi>Silla,</hi> obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Florus. lib.</hi> 79</note> 
                     <hi>Cinna</hi> the partener of <hi>Marius:</hi> for one of <hi>Pompeius</hi> ſouldiers having ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken dead to the ground one of <hi>Cinna</hi> his ſouldiers, hee diſarmed him, thinking to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſpoile him of all he had, but then finding him to be his own brother, this poore ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier fell in a great rage, and almoſt to a madneſſe, that he had ſo ſlaine his owne brother: yet ſtraight he cauſed a great fire of wood to bee made, to turne his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bodie into aſhes, after the manner of the Paynims then: and making great lamentations and ſorrowfull exclamations, he laid his brothers bodie upon the wood, then he put fire unto it, and as ſoone as it was well kindled, he caſt himſelfe into the fire alſo, and was burned with his brothers bodie: inſomuch, as death united the aſhes of thoſe two brethren, which the civile warres had diſunited. But yet a farre worſe and greater civile warre happened ſoone after betwixt <hi>Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and it endured and continued all the time of the Triumvirate of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>

It was verefied, That in this unnaturall civile warre from the beginning, till the fourth Conſulſhip of <hi>Caeſar</hi> only, there died of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21818:86"/>
citizens of Rome, the number of one hundred and ſeventie thouſand. And you

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> may very well beleeve, that many were after ſlaine; alſo, that tenne times as many died in ſo many provinces as belonged to the Romane empire: inſomuch, as theſe deteſtable warres ſwallowed up many millions of men. But the Triumvirate of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> was a moſt deteſtable union, which accorded to take unto them, all the governement of the commonweale, and to ſlay all their enemies. But becauſe it often came to paſſe, that he which was friend of one of the three, was the others enemie, when one would have him ſlaine as an enemie, the other would lay hold of him to defend him as his friend; yet the aboveſaid crueltie ſo ſurmounted all humanitie, and the deſire of vengeance ſo vanquiſhed all amitie, that theſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid captains entred into this deteſtable complot, that they ſold their friends one to another,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to have an enemie in exchange: as that wicked <hi>Anthonius</hi> to have <hi>Cicero</hi> his enemie (whom <hi>Octavius</hi> favoured as his friend) was content in exchange to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his owne uncle by the mothers ſide, called <hi>Lucius Caeſar,</hi> to <hi>Octavius</hi> his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; ſo that the one was exchanged for the other, and they both died. Can there poſſibly in the world bee conſpired a more barbarous diſloyaltie? Is it not a ſtrange thing to heare, that a friend ſhould be betraied to death, to have that cruell pleaſure to ſlay his enemie? Yet by this courſe and complot died an hundred and thirtie Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, beſides many other perſons of other qualitie. <hi>Antonius</hi> alſo the deviſer of this barbarous exchange, received his due reward even by <hi>Octavius</hi> himſelfe, whom hee had induced to commit ſuch cruelties. For in the end they were enemies, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>Antonius</hi> being vanquiſhed in the navall battaile at Actium, ſlew himſelfe, ſo tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon and againſt himſelfe that barbarous crueltie which hee had exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Cicero</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>And it needs not ſeeme ſtrange, if theſe civile warres of Rome endured ſo long time, as two and thirtie yeares: for the civile warres betwixt the houſes of Burgoigne <note place="margin">

And as for cruelties, me thinkes greater cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, than them which the Pariſians (the duke of Bourgoignes parteners) commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within the towne of Paris. For they maſſacred the Conſtable and Chancellor of France, whom they drew and trayled through the towne moſt filthily, and murdered

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> alſo many other great Lords, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Prelates, and more than three thouſand other perſons, as well gentlemen as other notable people, which by force they drew out of priſons to murder and maſſacre them as they did. The captaine of the commons, which committed thoſe barbarous inhumanities, was called <hi>Cappe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luche</hi> the executioner or hangman of Paris. Thoſe comparteners of the houſe of Burgoigne, not contented to ſuſcitate ſuch popular commotions &amp; ſtirs in France, but brought alſo the Engliſh men into Fraunce, which were like to have beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters therof: yet not herewith content, they cauſed king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt to war againſt his owne ſon, who after was called <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh, and one moietie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome againſt another. And not to leave behind any kind of crueltie, no not towards

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the dead, they cauſed to bee ſpread and publiſhed all over Fraunce, certaine Popes buls, wherby they indicted and excommunicated all the houſe of Orleance and his partakers both quicke and dead; inſomuch, as when there died any in the hands of the parteners of Bourgoigne, either by ward, priſon, or diſeaſe, they buried them not in the earth, but cauſed their bodies to be carried to dunghils, like carrion, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of wolves and ſavage beaſts. What could they have done more to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21818:87"/>
of all barbarouſneſſe and crueltie? Behold what fruits civile warres doe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bring: wee ſee it even at this day with our eyes: for there is no kind of crueltie, barbarouſneſſe, impietie, and wickedneſſe, which civile warres have not brought into uſe.</p>
                  <p>The prince then that is wiſe, will leave nothing behind, to appeaſe civile warres under his owne governement, but will ſpend all his care, power, and dilligence, to hinder it, after the example of that good and wiſe king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh, &amp; king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, his ſonne. <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh being yet Daulphin (the duke <hi>Iohn</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> contented not himſelfe herewith, but laid hold of the king (who by a ſickeneſſe was alienated of his wits) and of the queene, to make warre upon the Daulphin. Theſe occaſions ſeemed ſufficient to ſuch as then governed the Daulphin, and at laſt to the Daulphin himſelfe (being yet very yong) to enterpriſe an hazardous blow. He then ſent to the ſaid duke, that hee would make a peace with him, and prayed him they might appoint a place and day together to meet for that purpoſe. The day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, &amp; the place aſſigned at Montean-fant-Yonne, whither the ſaid duke came under the truſt of the word of the Daulphin his faith and aſſurance. As ſoone as hee arrived, making his reverence unto <hi>Monſieur le Daulphin,</hi> he was compaſſed in and ſtraight ſlaine, and withall alſo certaine gentlemen of his traine. <hi>Philip</hi> ſonne and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſucceſſor of this duke <hi>Iohn,</hi> tooke greatly to heart this moſt villanous death of his father, and ſought all the meanes he could to be revenged, which ſtill continued the civile warres. This meane while the Engliſh did what they could in France, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Normandie, Paris, the moſt part of Picardie, and marched even unto Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which they beſieged. The aboveſaid king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, died, ſo that <hi>Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur le Daulphin</hi> his ſon (who was called <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh) comming to the crown, and finding himſelfe deſpoiled of the moſt part of his kingdome, inſomuch, as in mockerie he was generally called the king of Bourges. This wiſe king well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That if civile warres endured, he was in the way to looſe all, one peece after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: hee therefore laid all his care, power, and diligence, to obtaine a peace and an

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> accord with the duke of Bourgoigne. Therefore he ſent in embaſſage unto him, his Conſtable, Chancellor, and others his cheefe Counſellors, to ſay, that he deſired to have peace with him, and that he well acknowledged, that by wicked counſell he had cauſed his father duke <hi>Iohn</hi> to be ſlaine at Monterean, and that if he had been then as adviſed and reſolute as hee was at that preſent, hee would never have committed ſuch an act, nor have permitted it to have beene done, but hee was young, and evill counſelled: and therefore in that regard hee offered to make him ſuch amends and reparation thereof, as he ſhould be contented therewith; yea, that he would demand pardon (althogh not in perſon) yet by his embaſſadors (which ſhould have expreſſe charge thereof) and prayed him to forgive that fault in the name of our Lord Ieſus

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Chriſt, that betwixt them two there might be a good peace and love: for hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to have done evill, being then a young man of little wit and leſſe diſcretion, by bad counſell ſo to ſley his father. And beſides this, he offred to give him many great lands &amp; ſeigniories, as the Countie de Maſconnois, S. Iangon, the Counrie de Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerre, Barſur Seima, la Counte de Boloigne, Surmer, and divers other lands: &amp; that during his life he would acquite him and his ſubjects of perſonall ſervice, which he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21818:87"/>
ought him as vaſſale of Fraunce, &amp; yet made many other faire offers unto him. This

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> duke <hi>Philip</hi> ſeeing his ſoveraign prince thus humiliate himſelf to him, bowed his cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage juſtly exaſperated for his fathers death, &amp; harkened unto peace, which was made at Arras, where there was held an aſſembly of the embaſſadors of all Chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of the counſell of Baſil, &amp; of the Pope; inſomuch, as there were there above 4000 horſes. All or the moſt part of thoſe embaſſadors came thither for the good of the king and his kingdome, but there was not one there which found not the kings offers good and reaſonable, as alſo did all the great princes &amp; lords of the kingdome, &amp; all the kings counſel: ſo that his majeſties embaſſadors (which were the duke of Bourbon, the countie of Richemont, conſtable of France, the archbiſhop of Rhemes chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the lord de Fayette, marſhall &amp; many other great lords) in a full aſſembly in the

And the duke of Burgoign declared, that he pardoned the king for the honor &amp; reverence of the death &amp; paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; for compaſſion of the poor people of the kingdome of France, &amp; to obey the Counſels reaſons, the Pope &amp; other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian princes, which praied him. Moreover, beſides the aforeſaid things, it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the ſaid duke, that juſtice &amp; puniſhment ſhould be done upon all ſuch as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> &amp; that the king himſelf ſhould make diligent ſearch through all his realme to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them. Here may you ſee how king <hi>Charles</hi> 6 appeaſed the civile wars of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by humilitie and acknowledgement of his faults: and from thence forward he proſpered ſo well, that after he had ended his civile wars, he alſo overcame his forrain wars againſt the Engliſh. And this came of God, who ordinarily exalteth the humble, &amp; overthroweth the inſolent &amp; proud. For aſſuredly it doth not evill become a great prince to temperat his majeſtie by a gracious humility, ſoftnes, &amp; affabilitie: but (ſaith <hi>Plutarch)</hi> it is a very harmonious &amp; conſonant temperation, yea, ſo excellent, as there cannot be a more perfect than this. But if the ſaid king had then had ſuch Counſelors as many kings now adaies have, what counſell would they hereupon have given him;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they would have ſaid: That thus to humiliate himſelfe to his vaſſall, as to ask him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenes, to confeſſe his fault, to acquitehim and his ſubjects of perſonall ſervice, theſe were things unworthy of a king: and that a king ought never to make peace, unleſſe it be to his honor, but ſuch articles were to his diſhonor and diſadvantage, and that he ought to have endured all extremities, before he had made any peace, whereby he ſhould not remain altogether maſter, to diſpoſe of perſons &amp; goods at his pleaſure. For how would not they ſay thus, ſeeing they ſay at this day, That it is no honorable peace for the king to accord his ſubjects any aſſurances with the exerciſes of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, &amp; a reformation of juſtice: yet you ſee, that all K. <hi>Charles</hi> 7 his Counſell, all the princes of his blood, all the great lords of his kingdome, all ſtrange princes embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> compelled the K. to paſſe more hard &amp; uneaſie articles to digeſt, for the good of peace. Should we ſay, that in ſo great a number of great perſonages, ther was not any ſo wiſe and cleare ſighted as the counſellors at this day &amp; as theſe Meſiers Machiave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: nay contrary, they were al wiſe men &amp; of great experience in wordly affairs, they were alſo of great knowlege, as the delegates of the counſel of the univerſitie of Paris, &amp; of the parliaments, wheras at this day, men know litle more than their <hi>Machiavell.</hi>

Heereupon ſtraight aroſe civile diſcention againſt the king, (which was called the warres of the common weale) and theſe men complained, that the kingdome was not politikelie governed, becauſe the king had put from him good men, and of high calling, to advance ſuch as were of ſmall eſtimation, and of no vertue. It was not long before the king acknowledged his great fault, and confeſſed it, not onely in generall, but alſo in particular to every of them, which he had recoyled and diſapointed: and to repaire this fault, he got againe to him all the ſaid lords, and ancient ſervants of the dead king his father, delivering

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> them againe their eſtates, or much greater: and in ſomme, he granted to theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth people, all that they demanded, as well for the generall as for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good of all people, and all to obtaine peace, with extinguiſhment of civile wars. If he had had of his Counſell the Machiavelliſts of theſe daies, they would not have counſelled him thus to doe; but rather would have told him; That it became not a king to capitulate with his ſubjects, nor ſo to unable himſelfe unto them, and, that a prince ought never to truſt to ſuch as once were his enemies, but much leſſe ought hee to advance them to eſtates, and that hee ſhould diligentlie take heede of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled enemie: yet notwithſtanding hee did all this, and it fell out well with him,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for he was very well ſerved, of the pretended reconciled enemies: and to this purpoſe <hi>Meſsier de Commines</hi> his chamberlaine, ſaith; That his humilitie, and the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his faults, ſaved his kingdome, which was in great danger to bee loſt, if hee had ſtayed upon ſuch impertinent and fooliſh reaſons, as thoſe Machiaveliſts alledge: for all things may not bee judged by the finall cauſe. What diſhonour then can it bee to a prince, to uſe pettie and baſe meanes, if ſo bee thereby hee make his countrey peaceable, his eſtate aſſured, and his ſubjects contented and obedient? what makes it matter, for him that is to aſcend into an high place, whether he mount by degrees and ſtaires of wood, or of ſtone, ſo that hee aſcend.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all, to ſay; That a prince ought to bee vigilant and carefull to make

                  <p>Heereunto ſerveth the advice of that noble and ſage companie, of the ancient Senators of Rome. There was a neighbour unto the Romanes, which were called the <note place="margin">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21818:88"/>
forces, ſent embaſſadors to Rome for peace: they were cauſed to enter into the place,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> where the Senate did ſit and becauſe they had not well obſerved the precedent treatie of peace, ſome Senators ſeemed hard to draw to give their cauſe any hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thinking it a vaine thing, to accord a peace unto ſuch as would not keepe any: notwithſtanding, ſome demanded of thoſe embaſſadors, what puniſhment they judged themſelves to haue merited, which had ſo often broken the precedent peace. One of them ſpeaking for all, and remembring rather the condition of their birth, than of their preſent eſtate, anſwered; That the Privernates merited the puniſhment, that they deſerve, which eſteeme themſelves worthie of a free condition, and which have a ſlaviſh condition. This anſwere ſeemed to ſome Senators, too hautie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming vanquiſhed people, yet the preſident of the aſſembly (who was a wiſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> man) benignly demanded of them, if they were pardoned the invaſion of the former peaces, and if now they had a new peace granted them, how they would obſerve it? The ſame embaſſador, with ſuch like hautineſſe of heart as before, If ſaid he, yee will give us a good peace, wee will faithfully and perpetually obſerve it, but if you give us an evill peace, it will not hold long. Some of the Senators diſdained and diſliked this anſwere, ſaying they ſpoke too proudly, and as it were already to threaten a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voult, and that it did not beſeeme vanquiſhed people, to carry ſuch high mindes: but the wiſeſt and diſcreeteſt part of the Senat, thought not this anſwere evill or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but that this embaſſador ſpake like a franke and free man, and that men ſhould not finde it ſtrange, if every man detained in ſervage, would bee remitted into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> libertie, as ſoone as hee can, and hath meanes for his purpoſe, and therefore reſolutely they conclude, That the Privernates muſt have ſuch a peace, as to bee received Romane citizens, enjoying the ſame liberties and priveledges, that they of the towne of Rome did. This was performed, and very notable is the reaſon of their motive: <q>For, ſay they, there is the peace loyall and aſſured, where men doe willingly appeaſe themſelves, and a man neede not looke or hope for an aſſured peace, where men are brought to a ſlaviſh ſubjection.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere is alſo to bee marked, the advice and opinion of <hi>Titus Livius</hi> dictator, which hee ſpake in a full Senat, upon that which the Latins demanded, that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dioniſius Halic. lib.</hi> 6.</note> of peace, that they had with the Romanes, might be confirmed unto them, which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> notwithſtanding they themſelves had broken, in rebelling againſt the Romanes, and beeing vanquiſhed; <q>Maſters (ſaid hee) my advice is, that wee ought to uſe kindlie and moderarelie, the victorie which wee have had againſt the Latins: for it is the moſt excellent praiſe that can come, either to publike or private perſons, not to ſuffer themſelves to be corrupted by proſperitie; but to know how to uſe that is good, with a modeſt and equall courage; becauſe all proſperities are accompained with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, yea although they come to oppreſſe the vanquiſhed, that make no reſiſtance. Moreover wee ought not, ſo much to truſt in fortune, which is too inconſtant and mutable (as wee have many times experimented) and therefore ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine our adverſaries to come to the laſt remedie, that is diſpaire, which often ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateth the heart, yea and often the fortune: we have cauſe alſo to feare the evill grace

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and diſfavour, of ſuch as wee would command, which ſhould come to paſſe, if wee ſhould alwaies ſhew our ſelves rude, and ſharpe towards ſuch as wee finde faulty. For our anceſtors have not obtained the ſeigniory and domination, which they have left us by ſhewing themſelves ſharp &amp; rigorous, but rather by appearing gentle, benigne and eaſie to pardon: moreover, wee muſt conſider, that nature hath given all men,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21818:89"/>
a deſire of libertie, inſomuch as the faults which men commit, being drawne on with

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> deſire, are greatly to be excuſed, and he that would puniſh them, which deſire a good thing, certainely it were the next way to overthrow all good order, and to bring in amongeſt men a confuſion, to murther and ſley one another. Finally (maſters) wee muſt conſider, that the beſt and moſt firme domination, is that, whereby ſubjects are more detained by good deeds in obedience, than that whereby they are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their duties by puniſhments: for a good will and well liking accompanieth the one, and feare the other; but whatſoever is feared, is alſo naturally hated: we muſt alſo imitate our anceſtors, which made themſeves great in building of townes, not in ruinating them; in drawing their neighbours into their citie, not in ſlaying them. I therefore conclude, that wee ought to renew and reconfirme to the Latins, the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> treatie of peace.</q> This opinion of dictator <hi>Largius,</hi> was followed by <hi>Servius Sulpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who reaſoned next after him, and generally by all the Senat, as full of all reaſon and equitie: and if at this day, men bee governed by reaſon, certaine it is that that opinion of <hi>Largius,</hi> ſhould bee ſufficient to ſhew to any prince, that to have a good and durable peace, hee ought to grant ſuch a one, as men will willinglie obſerve, which will bee done, whan thereby ſhall bee accorded a reaſonable liberty under a good aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>And as for aſſurances of peace, the elders in ſtrange warres, were wont to uſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages, <note place="margin">Aſſurances of peace.</note> but the principall bonds there, was publike faith and oth, whereof wee ſhall ſpeake in another place: as for civile warres, they had ſome other particular meanes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> beſide faith and othe; for they beſtowed offices of charge, and publike eſtates, upon ſome of them, and the other party if not egallie, yer ſo juſtly, as they could to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent both the one and the others. This often happened at Rome, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the third Eſtate, beeing oppreſſed of the greateſt and richeſt, for that cauſe there aroſe up ſome pupularie inſurrection: For the common means they uſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe ſuch ſtirs, was almoſt ordinarily to receive them of the third Eſtate, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, or to be cenſor, prieſt or Praetor, or to other offices; inſomuch as in the end all offices and Eſtates, were open to all ſorts of people, without diſtinction of nobles, or baſeſt trades, onely regarding their vertue &amp; good reputation, which alwaies carried away the price; untill they which were rich, began to buy the voices of election. And

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> truly it ſeemeth, that when they of the one partie ſaw themſelves recoyled from the eſtates &amp; charges of the body of the commonwealth (wherof they are members) and that they are rebutted &amp; eſtranged as ſuſpected perſons, that thereby they have juſt occaſion to diſtruſt themſelves, as other men put no truſt in them: And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the anſwere of <hi>Brutus</hi> is well to be marked (for ſuch as were of the third Eſtate in Rome) to the delegates and embaſſadours of the nobles and Patricians. Maſters (ſaith hee) they of the third Eſtate in Rome, know well that you lords Patricians are indeede men of our word, and that for nothing you will contradict your promiſes, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dioniſius Halic. lib.</hi> 6.</note> as wee never knew you did; and that you will very well obſerve towards them, all that you promiſe, without any neede of other aſſurance, than your faith and othe: but

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> they doe farther conſider, that after you which at this preſent doe governe, they which ſucceed will not obſerve that which you have promiſed: but will enterprice to handle the people tyrannouſly. And therefore there remaines but one ſole aſſurance to the moſt weake, which feare them which are ſtronger than themſelves; namely, to find meanes, that the ſtrongeſt may not hurt them, when they would: for ſo long as there remaines any meanes to hurt, there will never want will in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21818:89"/>
to execute. After that <hi>Brutus</hi> had uttered this ſpeech to the embaſſadors, the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Senat found it was founded upon reaſon, and they accorded to the people of the third eſtate magiſtrates, which were called Tribunes of the people. Theſe had the charge to defend the common people, againſt great men, with power to impriſon all ſuch, as ſeemed good unto them, and this magiſtrate proved very profitable, whileſt they uſed it well, but as ſoone as they abuſed it, it fell out to bee very pernitious; ſo is it of all other offices.</p>
                  <p>To demonſtrate, that men cannot keepe a peace, when thereby they are handled like ſlaves, the example of the Saguntines is very notable &amp; admirable. The Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Titus Livi. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Dec.</hi> 3.</note> a people of Spaine, were beſieged by <hi>Anniball</hi> of Carthage, who held them ſo ſtraightly in their city, that they had no meane left to eſcape or reſiſt. They being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to this extremity, <hi>Anniball</hi> ſent them word by one of his nation called <hi>Alorcus,</hi> to yeeld themſelves to ſave their lives: For courages (ſaid hee) muſt needes bee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, when forces failed; and <hi>Anniball</hi> would ſave their lives, if they would yeeld to him, and of his grace would deale well with them. Theſe poore people well conſidered the extreame danger wherein they were, and that they had no meane to eſcape <hi>Anniball</hi> his hands, but with yeelding unto him: and to yeeld they ſhould change their free, into a ſervile condition, which they feared ſo much, as they loved better to loſe their lives; therefore reſolved ſo to deale, as neither their bodies nor their goods, ſhould ever come into the power of <hi>Anniball.</hi> So they tooke choice of certaine young men of the towne, which they cauſed to ſweare, to defend the gates

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the towne, even to the death; that in the meane while the other townes-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, might have leaſure to execute their determination: after this the cheefe of the towne reſorted to the common market place, and there cauſed to bee laid on a heape, all the goods and treaſures of the towne, and about it to light a great fier, within which many caſt themſelves, and were burned, leſt they ſhould fall into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niballs</hi> hands, others ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, with their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, after putting fire thereunto, burnt the ſaid houſes, themſelves, and their goods; and the ſaid young men, which were truſted with the gates, made an end of fighting and living together. Was not heere (thinke you) an admirable love of libertie? for if they would but a while have lived under <hi>Anniball</hi> his yoake, there had beene

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hope that the Romanes their allies, would have delivered them; but yet they rather tooke choice, to loſe their lives, yea, &amp; that by a moſt ſtrange &amp; cruell death, than to ſuffer for a ſmall time, a ſervile ſubjection under <hi>Anniball.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as it is rare and unlikely, that a ſervile peace ſhould bee long and well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſo it is a very great fault, to breake a peace, when it is ſufficiently commodious <note place="margin">A tolerable peace ought not to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and tollerable. This was the onely cauſe, of the totall ruine, of that great &amp; flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonwealth of the Carthaginians: for after they had many times broken the treatie of peace, which they had with the Romanes, and had beene many times vanquiſhed; in the end they were altogether deſtroyed, and their townes raſed: and the cauſe that moved the Romanes thus to doe, was, for that they conſidered that the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Carthaginians would never obſerve faith, nor promiſe they made (which alreadie ſo many times they had violated, eſpecially ſince they were not at any time, bound to any hard condition of peace, but onely hindered to rebell or waxe great. <note place="margin">

                  <p>But the example of king <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, and of <hi>Perſeus</hi> his ſonne, is verie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in this matter. This king <hi>Philip,</hi> about ſome light occaſion, enterpriſed warre againſt the Aetolians, a people of Greece the Romanes allies. The Aetolians called to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21818:90"/>
their aid the Romanes, &amp; ſent an armie into Greece againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> under the charge

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of captaine <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> as well to ſuccour the Aetolians, as alſo the Athenians, which <hi>Philip</hi> would have deſtroyed, and laſtly to revenge themſelves of the king, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly had aided with ſilver, <hi>Anniball,</hi> to make warre upon them: after certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, this king fearing the forces, and vertue of the Romanes, did ſo much as hee wrought a peace with them: after that they had made this peace, hee obſerved it very well, all the reſt of his life; and the better to keepe it from point to point, hee had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in his hands, the articles of that peace, which hee ever read twiſe a day, that hee might not breake any point of it. When hee was dead, <hi>Perſeus</hi> his ſonne ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, unto whom a Macedonian gentleman, called <hi>Oneſimus</hi> (a faithfull friend and councellor of his father <hi>Philip)</hi> gave this advice to have ever in his hands, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> often to reade the ſaid treatiſe and articles of peace, that as his father had done, he might inviolablie obſerve them, as the onely meane to maintaine him in his eſtate. <hi>Perſeus</hi> at the beginning did but deſpiſe the admonitions of that good ſeruant <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> but in the end, hee had him in ſuſpition, and put him out of credit, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the good perſon, fearing worſe unto himſelfe, fled to Rome; After this, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> gathering great ſtore of money, and eſteeming himſelfe ſtrong enough to warre againſt the Romanes, by little and little, broke the articles of peace, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, altogether contrarying the contents of the articles, &amp; in the mean time covertly prepared for warre: finally the Romanes ſent againſt him the conſull <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> with a Roman armie, which in leſſe than a month ſeiſed upon all Macedonia, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> brought it into the Romane obedience, and tooke priſoners, the king <hi>Perſeus</hi> and his ſonne, which hee carried to Rome in a triumph, where they miſerably dyed in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: behold the evill haps of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> for not imitating the example of his father, in the obſervation of the treatiſe of peace.</p>
                  <p>Verely the prince which well conſidereth the good that comes by living in peace, will alwaies ſeeke to maintaine it, but at the leaſt within his owne domination, for in peace all things do flouriſh, and in warre all things are in ruine and devaſtation: we reade, that in the time of <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> all the Romane empire was in good peace, and that by the ſame meanes all the provinces were rich and flouriſhing, not onely <note place="margin">Capitol. in Antonio. Pio. Plinius in epiſt. ad Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianum.</note> in goods, but in vertues and ſciences: for at that time, good letters flouriſhed al over,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and eſpecially the civile law, which was ſo well practiſed, and in all places ſo good juſtice adminiſtred, that the whole empire was a moſt excellent, and admirable thing at that time. Moreover, that good emperour tooke a great delight to fabricate and build great works, and common buildings, as the Amphitheater, which he builded at Niſmes, where hee was borne (it is called at this day <hi>les Arenes)</hi> the temple of Adrian, his ſepulcher, and another Amphitheater at Rome, and many other goodly houſes and publike buildings moſt ſumptuous to behold; he alſo cauſed to bee repaired, bridges, gates, waies, &amp; to furniſh many townes with ſtore of money, as well to make new buildings in them, as to renew the old; heerein imitating the example of the emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> his predeceſſor, who immortalized his name by his publike works and buildings which hee made, even in building new townes, and ioyning rivers one

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to another, or to the ſea, by great and deepe channels, to aide and make eaſie the commerce of all countries; alſo in drying up great fennes and marriſhes, and in laying plaine, rocks and mountaines, to make fit waies for travailers, and in doing other notable workes. Such actions as theſe, are meet workes for peaceable times, and are honourable, and proper to immortalize the name of a prince, as to make
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21818:90"/>
warre to have victories and triumphs. We ſee that the reſtauration of good letters,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which king <hi>Francis,</hi> the firſt of that name (of happie memorie) brought into France in his time, did more celebrate and make it immortall, in the memorie of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an nations, than all the great warres and victories, which his predeceſſors had. And truly, princes which love and advance letters, doe well merit, that learned people ſhould ſend their honourable memorie to all poſterity: and ſuch as diſpiſe them, and hold them under feete, are not worthie that hyſtoriographers, and men of learning, ſhould bring their woords and victories into honour and reputation, much leſſe to immortalize them in the memorie of men. For as lawyers ſay, that they ought not to enjoy the benefite of lawes, which offend and deſpiſe them; ſo the prince, which makes no account of learning, ought not to enjoy the benefit thereof, which is to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> make immortall, generous, and vertuous men.</p>
                  <p>But if we make compariſon of the magnificence, and Eſtate that a prince ſhould <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Froiſar. lib.</hi> 7 <hi>cap.</hi> 353. 4.</note> hold in the time of peace and proſperitie, with that he ſhould hold during war and povertie, there is ſuch difference as betwixt the day and the night: for proofe hereof, I will alledge but the time of <hi>Philip de Valois.</hi> For wee reade, that in that time (which was a time of long peace) that king had almoſt ordinarie in his court, foure or five kings wich reſided with him, in regard of his magnificence, as the king of Boheme, the king of Scotland, the king of Arragon, the king of Navarre, the king of Maior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, &amp; many great dukes, counties, barons, prelates, the greateſt part of whoſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges hee defraied, that it might appeare, that the king of Fraunce was a king of kings. It

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is certaine, to maintaine this magnificall and great Eſtate, there muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low exceeding great expences: but hee might well doe it, for his people being ritch and full of peace, they had better meanes to furniſh and provide, for him a crowne, than in the time of warre, to give him a three halfe pence. At that time a king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, paſſed into France, to doe homage unto king <hi>Philip,</hi> for the dutchie of <hi>Guienne,</hi> which the Engliſh had long time held of the crowne of France: when the Engliſh king, ſaw the traine of the court of France, hee was raviſhed in admiration, to ſee ſo many kings, dukes, counties, barons, princes, peeres of France, conſtable, admirall, chancelor, marſhall, and many other great lords, which reputed themſelves happie to obtaine the good grace of king <hi>Philip.</hi> This moved the king of England far more

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> eaſily, and in other meanes to doe his homage, than he thought to have done; and at his returne into England, he ſaid on high: That he ſuppoſed, there was neither king nor emperor in the world, that held ſo magnificent and triumphant an Eſtate, as the king of France did. Should not we deſire to ſee ſuch a time againe? but we are farre from it, and take no courſe thereunto: for civile warres cannot bring us unto it, but onely a good and holy peace, well and inviolably obſerved, by a good reformation of juſtice, and of all eſtates, which was corrupted in France: For without it the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can never proſper, but ſhall alwaies bee gnawne and eaten even to the bones, and the people beeing poore, the king cannot be ritch, no neither his nobilitie, nor cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie: for all the kings revenewes, all tallages, all the nobilities and clergies rents, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> from the poore people.</p>
                  <p>By this which wee have above handled, this Maxime of warre is ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, I will add no more therunto, but that <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſhewes himſelfe a man of very good grace, when he ſaith, That the Italians are a people of nimble &amp; light ſpirits and bodies; for hee cannot more properly note them of inconſtancie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie; and when afterward he ſaith, That willingly they never go to battails, he can not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21818:91"/>
they any better taxe them of cowardiſe and puſillanimitie? but the reaſon, wherby

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he would ſeeme to couer this fault, is more to be accounted of, than the reſt: For ſaith he, this proceedeth of the little heart &amp; cowardiſe of the captaines; as if he ſaid, That all Italian captaines, are faint hearted &amp; cowards, which rather diſcourage than add heart unto their ſouldiers to fight. And heerein I beleeve, he ſaieth truth, for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Italian captaines, as wee have ſeene in France this fifteene yeeres, there hath not been one found that hath done any one memorable exploit: they can indeede make many vaine and brave ſhewes, and in many ſubtile ſtratagems, there are found no better warriors; but in battailes and aſſaultes of townes, they never by their wills, will come, as their owne <hi>Machiavell</hi> beareth them witneſſe.</p>

For although ſome poets and philoſophers praiſe the communitie of goods, remembring us of that old golden world of <hi>Saturne,</hi> yet

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> it is plainely evident to all people of judgement, that communitie induceth and brings a careleſneſſe, idleneſſe, diſcord, and confuſion into the commonweale, as learnedly <hi>Aristotle</hi> demonſtrateth in his Pollitiques. Therefore very neceſſary it is, that the naturall right therein be obſerved, and every man maintained in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his owne good, and that to every man be rendered that which is his owne: yea, this right ought to bee ſo obſerved, that it is not lawfull for the prince to breake or violate it: becauſe by reaſon of naturall right it is inviolable, and none can dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from it. And hereunto agreeth the divine right, whereby it is ſhewed unto us, that <hi>Achab,</hi> a king, ought not to take away the vineyard from <hi>Naboth</hi> his ſubject:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and hereunto alſo accord the rules of civile right, whereby it is ſaid, That the right naturall, and the right of nations are inviolable, in ſuch ſort, as that right civile and poſitive, neither can nor ought to derogate any thing from them.</p>
                  <p>Hereby therefore is ſeene the abſurditie and manifeſt iniquitie of this Maxime of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> who counſelleth a prince, as ſoone as hee hath conquered a new countrey, to diſpoſſeſſe the maſters and right owners, of their goods, in townes and places where he ſhall know it to be expedient to make himſelfe ſtrong; and to place there other new maſters and poſſeſſors of his owne nation, in their places who are diſpoſſeſſed and baniſhed. For if the prince uſe this Maxime, certaine it is: firſt that he violateth the right and law of nature, which hee ought not to doe: ſecondly, hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> acquireth the enmitie of the inhabitants of that new conquered countrey, which may be a meanes to deject him from all: For in the love of ſubjects and in their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie obedience lieth the firmeneſſe and aſſurance of a princes eſtate, as wee ſhall ſpeake in another place. It is folly to alledge, that there will bee no malecontents, but only they which are driven away: For ſuch (ſayth <hi>Machiavell)</hi> as remaine in the countrey, will be ſatisfied, becauſe they abide ſtill: but (as I ſay) it is folly to thinke ſo: For certainely, alwaies every one feareth that which he ſeeth happen to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and further, not onely our owne loſſes engender in us miſcontentment, but alſo others loſſes, as of our parents, friends, allies, yea, of ſuch as are not joyned unto us with other bond, than to be of our countrey, of our tongue, or of our religion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in all theſe there is a diſtinction of more and leſſe. Thirdly, they whom

imitate ſometimes the vertuous actions of generous princes, and that therefore he

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ought to follow the vicious actions of ſuch as are of no account; he ſhewed that he is together both wicked and ignorant: for what more wicked doctrine can be given to a prince, than to ſay, he ought to imitate wicked actions, becauſe ſometimes they ſucceed well?

And whereas he ſets downe the French nation amongſt ſuch as are moſt corrupted; we cannot denie it: but we may well ſay, That the doctrine of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> &amp; the frequentation of them of his nation, are cauſe of the greateſt and moſt deteſtable corruption, which is at this day in Fraunce: For of whome have the Frenchmen learned and knowne atheiſme, ſodomie, trecherie, crueltie, uſurie, and ſuch other like vices, but of <hi>Machiavell</hi> and of them of his nation: So that they may brag, that they are well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of the warres which our aunceſtors have made in Italie.

But ſuppoſe it was true, that <hi>Borgia</hi> helped Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> to the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Popedome, and that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> was unthankfull for that benefit, for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that he had of the old and ancient injuries that <hi>Borgia</hi> had ſometimes done him: what followes hereof? That all great lords will alwayes doe the like, will ſome Machiaveliſt anſwer; and that therefore they ought not to bee truſted: Is not here a goodly doctrine for a prince? Breefely, it is <hi>Machiavels</hi> mind to teach a prince to truſt in no lord, which hee hath once offended, and againe, that none which hath made a fault, or offended him, ſhall any more truſt him, whatſoever reconciliation, peace, concord, amitie, pleaſure, and good offices may happen ſince the offence. Here, behold a moſt wicked and deteſtable doctrine, to ſay, That an offence ought to take ſo deepe root in the heart of the offended, that by no pleaſures, ſervices, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> meanes, it can be raſed out. But <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſeemeth ſomething excuſable to maintaine this Maxime: for according to the honour of his nation, vengeances, and enmities are perpetuall and irreconcilable: and indeed, there is nothing wherein they take greater delectation, pleaſure, and contentment, than to execute a venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; inſomuch as, whenſoever they can have their enemie at their pleaſure, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged upon him, they murder him after ſome ſtrange &amp; barbarous faſhion, and in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21818:98"/>
murdering him, they put him in remembrance of the offence done unto them, with

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> many reprochfull words and injuries to torment the ſoule and the body together; and ſometimes waſh their hands and their mouthes with his blood, and force him with hope of his life to give himſelfe to the divell; and ſo they ſeeke in ſlaying the bodie to damne the ſoule, if they could: God by his grace keepe all countries, but eſpecially England (which alreadie is ſo ſpotted with other vices, and with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that <hi>Machiavell</hi> teacheth, and which they of his nation practiſe) that they be not ſoiled and infected with that immortall and irreconcilable vengeance. For how ſhould it be poſſible, that any man ſhould be without infinit quarels, and continual, and ordinarie batteries and murders, yea, with parents and friends, and with al other perſons, with whom he hath any frequentation; if offences may never be blotted out

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> but by vengeance? Every one may well know by experience, that they which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves great friends and familiars, yet commit offences one to another and ſometimes have great ſtirres, deſpights, and contentions amongſt them: But muſt men as ſoone as they receive any offence at the hand of a parent, friend, or of any other, forget and blot out all amitie, Chriſtian and brotherly charitie towards his neighbour, and to pardon no faults, but ſeeke the ruin of him that offendeth us? Surely, this is not onely farre from all Chriſtian pietie, but alſo from all humanitie and common ſence; yea, brute beaſts, which have no reaſon, are not ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <note place="margin">Irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right.</note> for a dog which we have offended, will be appeaſed with a piece of bread, yea, will fawne upon him which beat him, and as much will an horſe do and an oxe which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> hath ben pricked and beaten, when hey is given them: and as for ſuch as ſay, that vengeance is lawfull by right of nature, are greatly deceived, as the beaſts named before doe ſhew: True it is, that nature teacheth man and all living creatures to put backe violence with violence, when a man is upon the act, and inſtant it ſelfe when as violence is inferred: but it teacheth not, that after the act of violence &amp; outrage is committed, a man ought to ſeeke vengeance, to put backe that violence &amp; outrage: for this is not to repell and repulſe injurie, which already being received, cannot be repulſed; but rather to inferre a new injurie &amp; violence: &amp; withall, that naturall right, To repulſe violence with violence, it muſt be underſtood with reaſon &amp; equal mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; that is to ſay, That ſuch right hath place, when by no other mean in any other

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſort, we can ſhun the violence which is offered unto us: And indeed, the brute beaſts themſelves ſhew us we muſt ſo uſe it: for you ſhall not ſee a wolfe, nor a ſwine ſeeke to put backe the violence offered him, whileſt they have place enough to flie, and that they be not brought to a ſtrait: and therfore it is a beaſtly ignorance, to colour that deteſtable vice of vengeance, by the right of nature: for it is cleane contrarie, and eſpecially to the irreconcilable vengeance whereof <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſpeaketh, which he ſaith, cannot be defaced nor forgotten by new pleaſures. But I doe well know, that ſome Machiaveliſt will replie upon this doctrine, that <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſpeaketh onely of princes and great lords, unto whom he ſaith; That new pleaſures cannot extinguiſh old injuries, and that hereunto accordeth that which <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith:

But let the caſe be ſo, that the wrath and irritations of great princes and lords,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dwell longer in their hearts, than in other perſons of leſſe qualitie, as the meaning of <hi>Homer</hi> ſeemes to be: hereof it followeth not, that a prince is implacable, and that he cannot be appeaſed by any pleaſures or ſervices. It ſeemes that <hi>Homer</hi> noted no other thing in the particular natures of kings and great lords, but that they knowe how for a time to diſſemble deſpights and offences perpetrated againſt them, and can attend opportunitie to revenge them (a thing very true, and that wee ſee often practiſed:) But it is farre from <hi>Homer</hi> to ſay, that kings and princes cannot be appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by pleaſures and good ſervices that may bee done unto them after the offence, yea, in humiliating and reconciling themſelves to them. <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeakes here of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke kings, which are not maſters of themſelves, not being able to command their paſſions

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and affections which raigne in them, and which doe darken their reaſon and judgement, ſuch as was king <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> of whom he eſpecially ſpoke in the place above alledged. For many good and wiſe kings and princes are ſeene, which <note place="margin">Good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces encline to pardon.</note> can ſo well make their paſſions and affections obey reaſon, that not onely their wiſe judgement never ſuffereth, that a deſire after perpetuall vengeance ſhall take root in their hearts; but rather will not leave in their memorie the offences that are done them, but will forget and pardon them of their owne motion, before any pardon be demanded: for their wiſedome judgeth, that thoſe paſſions of vengeance, beſides that they doe but torment and make leane the heart of a prince, are altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the principall vertue, which ought to ſhine in a prince as clemencie, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and goodneſſe, a vertue making a princes eſtate pleaſing and aſſured, which ought principally to ſhine in privat offences, as juſtice ought eſpecially to ſhine in publicke offences, as ſhall be ſpoken more at large in another place: although even in publicke offences it is ſometimes requiſit for the publicke good and utilitie, that the prince uſe clemencie and forgetfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe is very regardable the opinion, that in the Senat, that great and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Titus Livi. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Dec.</hi> 3.</note> wiſe perſon <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus</hi> held. When the Romanes begun to get up and reproſper, after their ruine at Cannas, many of their allies, which had revolted to <hi>Anniball,</hi> profered to come to them againe: Amongſt others there was one <hi>Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Altinius Arpinus,</hi> who came to Rome, and made the Senat underſtand, That he

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had meanes to bring the towne of Arpos, where he inhabited, into their hands: The matter comming to deliberation in the Senate, ſome argued, That it was not good to truſt in this <hi>Altinius,</hi> nor in any other Arpinois, ſeeing they had violated their faith by revolting unto <hi>Anniball,</hi> and that it were folly to make account of ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which have their faith as variable as fortune: and as for his offer, to deliver the towne of Arpos, he did it for no good affection hee bore to the Romane common-wealth, but becauſe he ſaw the affaires thereof diſſolve and decay. But <hi>Fabius</hi> reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in another ſort: <q>Maſters (ſaid he) they which have ſpoken before, ſeeme to give their opinion, as if we were alreadie in good peace, forgetting the time lately paſſed and not conſidering that we are yet in the heat of warre: As for me, I think we ſtand

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in need to deviſe all the meanes wee can find out, to containe our allies from revolt: But if the neceſſitie of times lately paſt, and their weakeneſſe have drawne them on once to a revolt; and if after, it bee not lawfull for them to returne and to reconcile themſelves, who can doubt, but at length all our allies will turne from us to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians? My advice then is, That we ſhould not reject a reconcilation with ſuch as revolt from us, although they have not been ſo conſtant as they ſhould bee in a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21818:99"/>
faithfull adherence unto us.</q> The opinion of <hi>Fabius</hi> was followed by all the Senate,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and by the meanes of <hi>Altinius</hi> the Romanes reſeaſed the towne of Arpos.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeemeth, that the perſuaſion which <hi>Quintus Metellus</hi> uſed in the name of all the Senate, unto <hi>Aemylius Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Fulvius Nobilior,</hi> cenſors of Rome, is very worthie the marking, to ſhew, that vengeances and enmities ought not to bee perdurable in great lords, but ought to appeaſe themſelves, and be reconciled one to another. The ſaid two cenſors beeing two of the greateſt princes and lords of Rome, which had been conſuls, and endued with other great offices and eſtates, and at that time were cenſors, which was the greateſt office of all: For cenſors tooke cogniſance of all the abuſes of magiſtrates and ſenators, and might put them out: Theſe two being enemies (although companions in one charge) the Senate deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſeeke meanes to agree them: ſo they ſent unto them a great number of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> principall ſenatours, amongſt which, <hi>Quintus Metellus,</hi> who had the charge to ſpeake for all, in a temple where the cenſors were, begun to remonſtrate and tell unto them, as followeth: <q>Wee know (right honourable cenſors) that you are now in an eſtate to reprehend and correct the manners and faults even of ſenators, yea, it is in you to governe and correct us, and not in us to reprehend you: Yet have wee one thing from the Senate to ſay unto you, whereat all good men in you are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſcandalized: When we conſider of you apart, we know you to be ſuch, as in all the towne there cannot bee found men more capable and fit to bee cenſors and correctors, than you: but when we looke on you together, we feare you are not well

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> coupled; neither is that wherein you pleaſe us, ſo profitable unto us, as it may be domageable unto us, if that you two diſagree together: Therefore wee all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall entreat, that you will finiſh in this temple your enmities and rancours, and that in a good union of counſell and amitie, you will eſtabliſh elect ſenators, review our knights, and exerciſe all other points of your cenſorſhip. <hi>Titus Tatius,</hi> and <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> warred one againſt another, yet after governed in this cittie together in good concord and amitie: When warres are finiſhed, it is often ſeene, that men become good friends and faithfull allies, which before were mortall enemies:</q> There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">Amities ought to be immortall, and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mortal.</note> proverbe worthie of obſervation, That amities ought to be immortall, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities mortall: Therefore good maſters cenſors, we beſeech you bee reconciled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and hearken unto the Senates juſt petition. Straight after this ſhort orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although either of the ſaid cenſors deſired and were inſtant to make it appeare to the ſaid ſenators, that with good &amp; juſt cauſe they hated one another; yet they both ſubmitted themſelves to whatſoever arbitrement of thoſe ſenators. The ſaid Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors then thought it good, that they ſhould give their hands and faith one to another in token of reconcilation and amitie, and that both ſhould ſweare in that temple, that earneſtly and without all fiction they finiſhed their hatred, and in all true love reconciled themſelves: This they did, and ſolemnely ſwore, that with a good heart, and without all hypocriſie, they baniſhed and departed from all evill will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ever after good friends: All the Romane Senate (ſaith <hi>Titus Livius)</hi> praiſed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and greatly approved this reconcilation in theſe cenſors.</p>
                  <p>It is then an act of a good man and of an honourable nature, to bee facile and prompt to reconcilation, and not to engrave in our hearts perpetuall enmities and rancours, as <hi>Machiavell</hi> teacheth: and good men ought not only to be facile in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilation, but they ought alſo to contemne and diſdaine all revenges by way of action and violence, as beeing a courſe unlawfull, unfitting and unbecomming

him, that would conſerve in himſelfe the reputation of an honourable &amp; good man.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And this is it, which the hyſtorian <hi>Saluſt</hi> notably ſaith: <q>A good man (ſaith he) loves better to bee vanquiſhed, than by evill meanes to doe injurie: and to vanquiſh, in what ſort ſoever it be, if on the vanquiſhed there be practiſed too bitter a revenge, it is an evill and damageable thing, which often bringeth the totall ruine of Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monweales.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover generous and vertuous princes, ought not onely to bury and blot out all old injuries, with new benefits; but alſo even recent and new offences (which doe more nigh than old touch the heart) ought to bee forgotten, in conſideration of ancient pleaſures and merites.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> end was alſo ſuch as commonly tyrants have: for he was driven from his kingdome, which hee had unduly and unjuſtly uſurped, and was compelled to paſſe the reſt of his daies in great povertie, as a private perſon, baniſhed from Rome with all his children. And as for Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> hee was knowne for a true and diſloyall tyrant, who greatlie abuſed the bountie of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth: For that good king tooke from the Bentivolians, Boloigne, and many other townes from ſuch pettie lords as occupied them, and delivered them into the popes hands, becauſe they were lands belonging to the Romane church: Yet in recompence, this good Pope, by publiſhed bulls, expoſed the whole kingdome of Fraunce for a prey, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever would take it, together with all the countries and lands of the allies of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſeize upon part of them: A thing he eaſily effected: For at the inſtigation of the Pope his father, and of the Venetians, the king of Fraunce, <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, paſſed into Italie, and ſo ſoone as he arrived at Millaine, hee gave ſuccours to the Pope to ſubiugate Romania, vvhich ſtraight vvas reduced under the hands of <hi>Borgia,</hi> for the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the French puiſſance. Secondly, becauſe at Rome there were two mightie factions, the Colonoiſe and the Vrſine, againſt whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes he feared they would oppoſe themſelves; hee got on his ſide the Vrſine faction by faire vvords and promiſes, by the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> hee beat downe the French forces, and overthrew the Colonois: This being done, he gained the gentlemen, as vvell of the one faction as of the other, honeſtly according them, retaining them in his houſe, giving them governments of townes, and other honorable charges, after their merites and qualities: inſomuch, as in a little time the Vrſine and Colonois faction remained vvithout cheefetaines. After this, by faire and ſweet vvords, accompanied vvith good preſents, he cauſed the Vrſines to come to him unto Synagyllia, vvhich being once toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Having thus ſuppreſſed thoſe two factions, and ſeeing himſelfe peaceable, and all Romania and in the dutchie of Vrbin, to make himſelfe feared, &amp; to repreſſe the inſolencies of the pettie lords of that countrey, hee ſent thither, for governour, <hi>Meſsiere Remiro Dorco</hi> (a ſevere and cruell man) unto vvhom he gave

What then did <hi>Borgia?</hi> To make the vvorld beleeve, that ſuch cruell executions vvere not done by his command nor by his conſent, ſuddainly he cauſed publickely the head of <hi>Meſsier Romiro</hi> to be cut off: after this, being afraid of the Frenchmen, he refuſed any more to be ſerved with the French forces; ſo he put them away, and to aſſure himſelfe againſt them, he ſought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance vvith the Spaniards, vvhich then made vvarre in the kingdome of Naples, and ſo were farther off to hurt him, than the French which

And becauſe the law hereupon made by the emperours <hi>Gratian, Theſiodus,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> is worthie to be marked, I doe thus tranſlate it: <q>If it happen that heereafter (ſay they) wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

                     </q> It is then ſeene by this law, that <hi>Meſsier Romiro</hi> was juſtly puniſhed, as a man too prompt and forward to execute crueltie: And if this law had been well obſerved in France, there had not beene found ſo many, and ſuch raſh maſſacres, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth had beene in farre better eſtate, and the meanes of peace, more facile

                  <p>Moreover, the prince which will propoſe one man alone as his patterne, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar <note place="margin">True pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns which a prince ought to propoſe to imitate.</note> to imitate, hee ſhall finde many, which have beene as vertuous as <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> was vicious: But ſeeing the greateſt and moſt excellent perſons at all times, were ever men, that is to ſay, not every way abſolute, but defectuous and vicious ſome way; it is beſt therefore that a prince doe adict himſelfe to imitate all vertuous men in generall, and each of them in their particular vertues: As if wee ſpeake of heathen princes, hee may propoſe to imitate the clemencie of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in uſing his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: for hee ever ſimply contented himſelfe to vanquiſh, without crueltie, and with out bloodſhed, as farre as hee could: Hee may propoſe to follow the moderation of

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21818:103"/>
ordinances according to the rules of juſtice, but alſo he himſelfe often heard mens

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cauſes, and judged them their right: hee was alſo a lover of learned men, and of knowledge, and greatly rewarded them; and theſe vertues of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> were fit for a prince to imitate. The bountie and lenity of <hi>Traianus;</hi> the love of peace in <hi>Pius;</hi> the deepe wiſedome, the humanitie and facilitie to pardon, and the love and ſtudie of good letters in <hi>Marcus Antonine,</hi> are alſo worthie vertues for a prince to follow. But without any longer ſtay upon Paynim princes, which had not the knowledge of Chriſtian religion, a prince ſhall finde ſufficient to imitate, yea, and not to goe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the kings of France. <hi>Charlemaine</hi> was as generous and victorious, as ever was <hi>Caeſar;</hi> yet beſides this; hee was very liberall towards good people, a prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, gentle, facile to pardon enemies, and endowed with a ſingular pietie and feare

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of God; For hee cauſed ordinarily the Bible and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to be read unto him; and nouriſhed poore people in his pallace, which ſometimes ſerved himſelfe at the table. Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> was a good and wiſe king, fearing God, and a good juſticer; for hee often ſent into all his provinces commiſſaries, to bee informed of the abuſes, covetouſneſſe, and rapines of magiſtrates, and cauſed them which were found faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to bee well puniſhed. Wee reade one thing of him, not unworthie to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, That one day as hee was praying unto God, reciting certaine petitions of the pſalmes of <hi>David,</hi> fit for that action, one comes ſodainely unto him, to deſire a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for one that had committed a fault, which was death by law; hee as ſodainely graunted it; but ſtraight falling into a verſe of the pſalme, which ſaith<hi>: Beati qui fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt</hi>

                     <hi>Iuſtitiam in omni tempore.</hi> Bleſſed are they which doe juſtice at all times: hee immediately called him againe, unto whom hee had graunted the ſaid pardon, and revoked it, with this notable ſentence: That the prince which may puniſh a crime, and doth it not, is as culpable himſelfe, as hee that committed it; and that it is a worke of pietie, and not of crueltie to doe juſtice: Beſides he was very chaſt, far from all lubricitie, and never thirſted after revenge. <hi>Charles le Sage</hi> was a very benigne and humble prince, who did nothing but by well digeſted counſell without raſhneſſe, loving the good and ſafetie of his ſubjects; hee was alſo a prince that very much feared God, he tooke great delight in reading the Bible, and would his people ſhould reade it, and to that end, he cauſed it to bee tranſlated into French. The Prince then

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which will determine with himſelfe, onely to imitate thoſe three kings, in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid vertues, certainely hee ſhall have for himſelfe a true pattern and example, ſuch as Chriſtian prince ought to have; and not to propoſe to himſelfe this ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtard prieſts ſonne, who was a very monſter, and an exemplar of all wickedneſſe: I name him a baſtard, becauſe according to the divine and civile law, hee was not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, although by the cannon law, the Pope may legitimate prieſts baſtards, and by conſequent his owne, as hath beene above touched: Yet notwithſtanding this queſtion is not without doubt, whether the Pope can legitimate his owne baſtards? <note place="margin">Queſtion, if the pope can legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> and the reaſon of the doubt is, becauſe the doctors of law hould, That legitimation is an act &amp; exerciſe of juriſdiction: But it is an undoubted Maxime, that none can

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> exerciſe juriſdiction in his owne deede; &amp; therefore it ſeemeth, that the illation doth not evill conclude, That the Pope cannot legitimate his owne baſtards: but ſeeing wee are entred into this talke, wee will deeper looke into the matter, to draw out ſome good reſolution, from this queſtion, by the way onely of a tentative and pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>putation, and not of a full determination heereof: For as <hi>Cato</hi> ſaith amongſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, ioyous and mery things would bee ſometimes mixed.</p>

Vpon this queſtion then, namely; Whether the Pope can legitimate his own ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards?

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> there do appeare unto us many ſtrong and ample arguments, as well in law, as in ſpeculative Theologie, and as well for the affirmative, as the negative. For, on the affirmative, they alledge that by law and right of nature it is given to man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create his like; ſo that when the Pope exerciſeth the act of procreation, therein hee doth nothing which agreeth with the law of nature: This for the firſt: Secondly they alledge that Popes are called fathers, and therefore they ought to have children, for the name of father is relative to the name of the ſon, &amp; one of them cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other: Thirdly it is a point altogether peremptorie, and ſuch as no reply can bee made againſt it, namely, that by the cannons and papall conſtitutions, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely determined, that the Pope ought to bee garniſhed and furniſhed with geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> otherwiſe hee were incapable and unable to bee Pope, by the diſpoſition of law, without any other declaration. Inſomuch as if there happen ſo great a miſchiefe and unhappie hap to Chriſtendome, as by adventure they elect an eunuch Pope, all whatſoever hee doth were nothing woorth, nor of any value; ſo that his bulls and collations of benefices, his diſpenſations, fulminations, aggravations, pardons, legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations, and other like proviſions ſhould have no ſtrength, vigor nor effect: which is an admirable point in law, to ſay that a privation of genitories ſhould induce a nullitie of bulls, as if the Popes power depended altogether upon his genitories: But hereof ſome yeeld this reaſon, becauſe ſay they; eunuches commonly are effeminate, having neither the force nor power which naturall men have, ſo that it ſhould not

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> bee found ſtrange, that the cannons will, that the Pope muſt be accounted without force and power, when he is without genitories. Others whom this reaſon ſatisfieth not, doe ſay, That the cannons in this place containe a right poſitive; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath been conſtituted by a poſitive right, a reaſon cannot be rendered of it; and that we muſt content our ſelves and be ſatisfied, that it hath beene ſo ordained, That the Pope ought to have genitories, without further enquiring the reaſon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Yet if it were requiſit to yeeld a reaſon of that conſtitution, we muſt rather ſay, it was ordained, to ſhut the gate of the Popedome from Papeſſes or ſhee Popes, which otherwiſe might have crept into that holy ſeat, as the Papeſſe <hi>Ioan</hi> did. But out of this doctrine of the cannons, which importeth, That all Popes ought to be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with genitories, men draw out corolaries and conſequences, which marvellou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly ſerve to the confirmation of the affirmative of our queſtion: For if it bee ſo, ſay the cannoniſts, that it is requiſit by a neceſſitie, that the Pope muſt have genitories; it followeth, that it is for ſome end and uſe: For it were very abſurd to ſay, that by the cannon law, any thing hath beene ordained without any end, becauſe all humane actions are done to ſome end and utilitie, and by conſequent (with ſtronger reaſon) the ordinances of the cannon law ought to tend to ſome end: But it is ſo, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitories can ſerve for nothing but for generation; and therfore it followeth, that the Pope ought to uſe them to that worke. And if any object, that he ought to uſe them for generation in the eſtate of marriage; the replie to overthrow it, is very readie,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> founded upon the univerſall vow of the Catholicke Romane Church, whereby all Eccleſiaſticall perſons (and eſpecially the Pope, chiefe of them) have made a vowe never to be married: If then it be not lawfull for the Pope by the doome of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Romane Church to be married, as alſo by cannonicall conſtitutions, it is of neceſſitie that he have genitories (which he cannot have, but for ſome uſe) it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followeth, that he may and ought to have baſtards. This argument may bee
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21818:104"/>
reduced under the firſt forme of the firſt figure of Syllogiſmes in <hi>Barbara;</hi> which (as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Logicians ſay) of all other are the beſt concluding arguments. But (ſay they) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king now this concluſion for a cleare and well prooved Maxime, that the Pope by diſpoſition of right ought to have baſtards; wee ſhall eaſily come to the affirmative of our queſtion: For they are called legitimate children, which are procreated after the ordinance and permiſſion of law and right, and therefore the Popes baſtards ſhall be found alreadie legitimate from their creation; but much more, when farther the Pope himſelfe (which can doe all in all) legitimateth them: For this legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a ſuperabundant act, which cannot but ſerve, and at the leaſt cannot hurt; becauſe that which is abundant, impaireth not the reſt; &amp; that each act ought to be taken to ſome end and profitable operation.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>They which hold the negative part of our queſtion, have other contrarie argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Pope (ſay they) is bound, as other Eccleſiaſticall people are, to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vow of the church, and therefore he ought to obſerve the vow as well as others; eſpecially, that he may bee a good example to other prieſts: For if the Pope (who commonly is an old man) diſpence with himſelfe to have baſtards, and doe breake chaſtitie and continencie required in the prieſtly order; what an example ſhould that be for a companie of young prieſts, which are idle and at their caſe? To ſay that nature hath given men genitories for procreation, it is true (ſay they;) but they muſt be uſed in marriage: And if that be a good reaſon, we may then ſay, that it is lawfull for all prieſts to breake the vow of chaſtitie: But the truth is contrarie: For none

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ought to make himſelfe prieſt, nor to bind himſelfe unto that vow, unleſſe hee know in himſelfe a power to obſerve it. To ſay alſo, that Popes are called fathers, this is true (ſay they) but it muſt be underſtood ſpirituall fathers, not carnall fathers: And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the holy decrees it is ordained, That the Pope ought to have genitories, that is to ſhew (ſay they) that he is a perfect man, having all his members, as it is requiſit he have: And when that decree was made, that the Pope ſhould have genitories, wee muſt not underſtand thereby a diſpenſation from the vow of the univerſall church, whereunto he remaineth alwaies tied and bound: For by the Cannons, the Pope cannot diſpence againſt a ſtatute and ordinance of the univerſall church: So that by conſequent (ſay they) he cannot have baſtards, which are not alwaies baſtards &amp;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> illegitimate; and he cannot juſtly legitimate them, becauſe hee cannot exerciſe an act of juriſdiction in his owne cauſe or action. Theſe are the reaſons of ſuch as hold the negative part of our queſtion. True it is, that they accord well, that by plenitude of power, the Pope may legitimate his owne baſtards, when hee expreſly declareth, that he will have it ſo of his full and abſolute power: and herein all the Cannoniſts agree. For when they ſpeake of the fulneſſe of the Popes power, they ſpeake as of a deepe pit, which is bottomeleſſe, from whence none can come out, when they are once in, no more than if a man were ſunke into ſome unmeaſurable &amp; infinit deepe gulfe of the ſea: For they hold, that it is an infinite thing, which hath neither end nor beginning, neither up nor downe, neither banke nor bottome, neither mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> nor extremitie: yet without wading too farre in it, we will ſpeake a little thereof ſomething merrily: for the matter is pleaſant ynough, as it hath been handled of the doctors of the facultie of Theologie, which doe not well accord in this point with the Cannoniſts and Decretiſts. <note place="margin">Of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the pope and of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt then preſuppoſe and underſtand, that there is an old and ancient que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which is not yet decided for want of a judge, that is, Which is the great maſter,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21818:105"/>
the Counſell or the Pope. This queſtion hath been many times diſputed upon, but

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it could never find a competent judge to diſſolve it: For who durſt take upon him to judge the Pope, ſeeing kings and emperours are his ſubjects and vaſſales (as hee ſaith) and doe owe him obedience, and are bound to hold his bridle and ſtirrops, when he mounteth on horſebacke? The ſubject and inferior cannot be a judge over his lord and ſuperiour, this is certaine: And indeed there was never found king nor ſuperiour, which durſt enterpriſe to end that ſtrife betwixt the Pope and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: ſo that untill this day it remaineth undecided: yet during this ſaid ſtrife &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the Cannoniſts have alwayes firmely held their opinion, which is, that the Pope is the greateſt maſter; but the doctors of the facultie of Theologie have held and practiſed the contrarie, that the Councell is cheefe maſter: The Cannoniſt doctors doe found upon many reaſons, which ſeeme not to bee weake, nor evill, to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſuch as will not examine things too ſubtillie: For (ſay they) the Pope and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell repreſent God and the Church; and even as God is above the Church, ſo the Pope ought to be above the Counſell: Moreover, a certaine thing it is, that every Counſell is compounded of men in kind (I doe diſcreetly ſay, in kind, to cut off an objection, namely, that the Counſell might be compoſed of beaſts in wit and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:) But the Pope is more than a man, and by conſequent is greater than the Counſell. As for this point, that the Pope is more than a man, there need no doubt be made therof: for there are expreſſe texts ynough in the Cannon law, which hold <note place="margin">C. quanto. &amp; ſim. ex de tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlat. epiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o.</note> &amp; reſolve it in proper tearmes: Theſe Cannoniſt doctors alſo hold upon this point,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> That the Pope is neither God nor man: not that therefore they meane, that hee is a beaſt, but that there is a certaine thing betwixt them, which is more than a man, and leſſe than God. The third argument of the Cannoniſts, is, that they ſay: That the Pope repreſenteth the great and cheefe ſhepheard, and the Counſell the pettie and underling ſhepheards; and that therfore the Pope muſt needs be above the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, as the head ſhepheard is above inferiour ſhepheards. The fourth argument is, becauſe the keyes of Paradice were given to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who after left them unto the Popes his ſucceſſors, not to the Counſell: So that (ſay they) if the Pope would rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly deale with them of the Counſell, hee would not ſuffer them to enter into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice; for, to enter into it, we muſt only ſpeake unto him, ſeeing he only carieth the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> keyes thereof; yet he will not doe his worſt unto them, although they give him great occaſions, calling themſelves greater maſters than he.</p>
                  <p>The doctors of the facultie of Theologie (to ſuſtaine the contrarie, and to make appear, that the Counſell is greater than the Pope) uſe many ſubtile and ſpeculative arguments, into which every man cannot enter, for their great ſubtiltie: for when they ſpeak of this matter, they ſeeme to beat, into as ſmal duſt as Epicures Atomes, the ſubtilties of S. <hi>Thomas de Aquin,</hi> and <hi>Scotus:</hi> For they deſtinguiſh the Pope from the papalitie, and ſay, that there is a ſpirituall papalitie, and a poteſtative papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and that both of them are not alwayes concurrent in one papall ſubject. For the ſpirituall papalitie may bee deficient in the ſubject, by a defectuoſitie of ſcience,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and the poteſtative by a defectuoſitie in the election: After this, they give many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations to the ſaid double papalitie, according to which, they ſay the Popes power and actions ought to be governed. But without entring into theſe ſo ſubtile argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, out of which I cannot diſpatch my ſelfe with credit, I will only touch ſuch as may beſt be comprehended of men of meane underſtanding. They firſt ſay, that the Counſell may create and depoſe the Pope, as hath been many times ſeene; therfore
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21818:105"/>
the Counſell is greater than the Pope: for hee that hath power over another, to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> make and unmake, muſt needs be the greater maſter. Secondly, they ſay, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell repreſenteth the univerſall Church, which cannot erre in faith: and the Popes have often erred in faith, and amongſt them have beene found many heretickes, which for ſuch have been condemned in Counſels: and therfore men ought rather to preferre the Counſell, which cannot erre, before the Pope, which is ſubject unto error. They alſo ſay, that even after the Cannons themſelves, the Pope alone cannot decide the articles and differences of faith, but that it appertaineth to the Counſell; and therefore that the Counſell which hath a more excellent power, than the Pope, muſt needs be reputed greater than hee. Fourthly, the Pope, although he be preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Counſell, yet he neither hath nor ought to have but one voice, no more

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> than a ſimple biſhop; and therfore all the body of the Counſell muſt needs be more than hee, as the body of a court of parliament is more than one of the preſidents thereof. Fiftly, they ſay, that when our Lord promiſed to give the keyes of paradice, hee ſaid thus: I will give you the keyes of the kingdome of heaven: Here you muſt note, that he ſpeaketh in the plurall number, addreſſing his ſpeech to many, namely to all his Apoſtles, not to S. <hi>Peter</hi> alone, and he ſpeaketh alſo of many keyes, which can be in no leſſe number than two, ſeeing there is a plurall number: but theſe two keyes, are the keyes of knowledge, and the key of power, wherof the firſt belongeth to the Counſell properly, yet the Pope beareth them both in his armes: without the key of knowledge; they ſay the other is not to bee accounted of, neither can in any

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſort open the gate of Paradice, for the doubtfull crookes and bendings of the inward parts of the locke, and the hidden bolts thereof, which cannot be opened, but by the key of knowledge: inſomuch, as ſeeing the Counſell holdeth the principall key, it followeth, that it is greater maſter than the Pope. Theſe are in ſumme the cheefe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of theſe doctors, that I remember at this preſent: But beſides theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there is alſo a practiſe held in that cauſe, as well by all princes as univerſities, which have ordinarily judged and practiſed, that the Counſell is above the Pope: As in the time of king <hi>Philip le bel,</hi> the fourth of that name, Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight <note place="margin">Annal. upon <hi>Anno</hi> 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> without any other commiſſance or declaration: The king, becauſe this was againſt his priviledges, (by the advice of his Counſell, the prelates of his countrey, and the facultie of Theologie of Paris) appealed from the Pope, as inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, to the firſt future Counſell, as ſuperior. Likewiſe, in the time of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the fift, who would needs levie tenthes upon the French cleargie, it was reſolved by all the univerſitie of Paris likewiſe, to appeale from him and his bull to the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Counſell. And to be ſhort, appellations have been common from the Pope as inferior, to the Counſell as ſuperior: And indeed, the doctors in Theologie hold all determinately this Theorique, That the Counſell is greater than the Pope: yea, ſome Theologians have gone ſo farre, as to ſay, that men may well be without the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Pope.</p>
                  <p>By the aboveſaid diſcourſe is ſeene, that our maſters of Theologie have deſired to circumſcribe the infinite plenitude of the Popes power, by giving him a maſter, and a ſuperior; namely, the Counſell, to keepe him within his limits. But I finde his power cut much ſhorter by other means<hi>:</hi> and firſt, upon this generall rule, <hi>The Pope</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Limit. of the Popes power.</note> 
                     <hi>may doe all:</hi> they adde a condition and moderation thus: <hi>Clave non errante,</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21818:106"/>
that the key doe not erre. This is a moderation right pleaſant, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as much or more than the rule it ſelfe: For if you will ſearch the bulls, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and diſpoſitions of the Pope, you ſhall not find one which containeth not ſome derogation from law and right: which derogation &amp; repugnancie from right, the Pope doth, by vertue of his power, and becauſe it ſo pleaſeth him: So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaid condition, laid downe by the divines, we may well ſay; ſuch bulls are of no value, becauſe they containe an error in law, againſt which the Pope hath no ſtrength, according to that ſaying, <hi>Clave non errante.</hi> Likewiſe, by the ſame modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſtriction it may be ſaid, that a great part of the Cannons and Decretals are nothing worth, becauſe they are derogatorie from the divine law, or equitie, and naturall reaſon; or els, becauſe by theſe Cannons and Decretals, there is added to the holy Scripture, which God hath forbidden: The key then of Popes beeing thus

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> falſified in ſo many ſorts and manners (as every day it is) there can little good remain in any thing the Pope hath ever done or yet doth, but all or the moſt part ſhal be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for want of power, which is the greateſt nullitie that is.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another reſtriction or exception from the foreſaid rule, which Saint <note place="margin">2. Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                     <hi>Thomas de Aquin</hi> maintaineth firmly &amp; ſtoutly, that is: He ſaith, That the Pope may do all things, but except that he can make no new articles of the Faith: This is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which ſtretcheth far and wide, &amp; much diminiſheth the infinit power of the Pope: For if it be true, that he can make no new articles of faith, it followeth, that we ought not to beleeve nor give credit to any thing the Pope hath invented himſelfe:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and ſo we ought ſimply to hold our ſelfe to the word of God, and not to looke to any additions, ſubtractions, nor multiplications of the Pope: Wherefore by <hi>Thomas</hi> his limitation, what precepts ſoever are added to the Decalogue, as this: <hi>Dominicis die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus miſſas audito,</hi> On Sundaies heare Maſſes, and ſuch like, are utterly to be rejected: And generally, all that the Popes have ordained, which is contrarie, or in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repugnant from any place of holy Scripture, muſt be caſt off as a new article of the faith. For we muſt as well in deed as with the mouth, confeſſe and beleeve all that is contained in the old and new Teſtament, and all the verſes generally of the whole Bible ought to bee unto us ſo many articles of the Faith; although there are ſome more principall and neceſſarie than others: inſomuch, as all the Popes doctrine,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which repugneth the leaſt verſe of the Scripture, is to be rejected as a new article of the faith, by the ſaid exception of S. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides the two foreſaid limitations, there is yet another very common amongſt <note place="margin">3. Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the Theologians and Cannoniſts: For herein do they agree, That an hereticke Pope hath no power, nor ought to have any obedience yeelded unto him. This hath often ſerved for a meane to cut off and to limit the Popes power: For ever when he waxed too wild, furious, and troubleſome to the world, then would they caſt him this bone to knaw on, to ſay, <hi>Thou art an hereticke:</hi> and ſo was hee often abandoned, ſo that none made any account of him: as it happened to Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> of Avignon, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixt: For this <hi>Benedict</hi> ſent buls to the king of France, whereby

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he flatly excommunicated the king and all his realme, becauſe the king would not ſuffer ſilver to goe out of France into Avignon: The aboveſaid king had his recourſe to the Vniverſitie of Paris, and eſpecially to our maſters of the facultie of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, which ſtraight concluded and reſolved, That Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> was an heretick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie the name of a Pope, and that men ought not to obey him, his bulls being of no value, as granted by one without all power: and therefore according to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21818:106"/>
the ſaid buls were rent and torne in pieces, and all obedience denied the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Pope. You may demaund why this Pope was called an hereticke: I anſwere, that I know not, for our hyſtorians have not ſet downe in what articles of the Faith he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And it may be, that of purpoſe they impoſed the name of an hereticke, and not becauſe he was ſo, for he knew nothing of the Scriptures, neither knew he what the name of an hereticke meant: yet for ſuch was hee accounted and pronounced, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he knew no Theologie, nor had ever ſeene any thing of the Bible, but onely that which is drawne out of it, and inſerted in the Miſſall and Breviarie: He was alſo a reaſonable good clarke in the Cannons, yet not one of the profoundeſt therein, but he knew ſufficient for his proviſion. Likewiſe, the Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> of whome wee have before ſpoken, was declared an hereticke by the ſaid Vniverſitie and facultie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Theologie, not that he erred in the Faith (for it was a thing whereof hee had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care) but becauſe he would needs enterpriſe upon the kings priviledges: But as ſoone as he was declared an hereticke, all the kingdome of France retired from his obedience. Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, was not declared an hereticke by the Vniverſitie, becauſe they thought it better ſo to proove him in Italie at a Counſell there, that ſo Italie it ſelfe might alſo withdraw from his obedience: And indeed (do the Pope what he could) a Counſell was held at Piſe, where he was endighted for an heretick, but he died before the ſentence was given. Breefely, of old it was a good and gentle meanes to bridle the unmeaſurable power of the Pope, to declare and deſcrie him for an hereticke: Our maſters alſo of that time (I know not what they do now) defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an hereticke to be he, which either in fact or opinion doth contrarie to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the church: So it was very eaſie to convince Popes of hereſie: for although they maintained no opinions contrarie to the doctrine of the Catholicke Romane faith, yet no doubt they did many things reprehenſible by that doctrine; and that ſufficed ſtraight to make them heretickes.</p>
                  <p>You have heretofore underſtood the controverſie betwixt the Pope &amp; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, <note place="margin">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was decreed, That <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſhould looſe his Popedome, &amp; in his place ſhould come <hi>Ame de Savoy,</hi> called Pope <hi>Foelix,</hi> who a little before had reſigned to his ſon <hi>Lewis</hi> his dutchie, lands, and ſeignories to become an hermite at Ripaille, a ſolitarie place in Chablais. This Pope beeing choſen, <hi>Eugenius</hi> begun ſtraight to cauſe very rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bulls to be publiſhed againſt him, and anathematized him, if hee continued to call himſelfe Pope. <hi>Foelix</hi> the new Pope ſtood ſtiffe, and all the Counſell for him, which was tranſlated from Baſil into the towne of Geneva, where this Pope held <note place="margin">Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> ſate at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</note> his ſeat, and from thence diſpatched as forcible bulls againſt <hi>Eugenius,</hi> &amp; made no account of his anathematizations; but hoped well that hee ſhould remaine maſter and head of the Church (at the leaſt on this ſide the mounts) if once he could place

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his ſeat at Avignon, as other Popes had done: But becauſe he placed his ſeat at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, the king of Fraunce would not depart from the obedience of <hi>Eugenius</hi> Pope of Rome, although he ſomething enclined to the Counſell of Baſil, and approved the reſolutions made there. Moreover, he did ſo much, that in the end hee agreed Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> with Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> ſucceſſor of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in the year 1447: And Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> contented himſelfe to be the Popes perpetuall vicar in Savoy, after hee had
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21818:107"/>
enjoyed tenne yeares the Popedome; having alwayes his ſeat at Geneva, as well of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Pope, as of the Popes great perpetuall vicar. And after this concord made, <hi>Foelix</hi> acknowledged Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> for true Pope, as alſo did all they which had elected <hi>Foelix,</hi> &amp; remained with him at Geneva: Therfore from that time forward was there <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Felix</hi> ſate Pope at Geneva.</note> no Pope at Geneva, neither would they of Geneva receive any into their citie again as I heare. And for as much as the Pragmaticke ſanction (which were certaine arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles touching the matter of benefices, which were reſolved upon in the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell) greatly diminiſhed the Popes revenues, and the Bulliſts and Datances at Rome; the Pope never ceaſed, till he had aboliſhed it in Fraunce, by the meanes of a biſhop of Arras, a great favourite of the kings, whome the Pope made cardinall, giving him a red hat in recompence of his paines. So from that time was aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the ſaid Pragmaticke, which had endured and was after a ſort obſerved &amp; kept in France for the ſpace of thirtie yeares, to the great diſcontentment of the nobles and of ſuch as were rich (who could not ſo eaſily and fitly, whileſt the Pragmaticke laſted, abuſe the Pops bulls and indulgences) as they did before and ſince. True it is, that whileſt the Pragmaticke was in force (which favoured learned men) the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and rich men by quirkes and litigious contentions of law, ſo troubled the poore graduates, that they were commonly repelled from the fatteſt benefices: for officers of juſtice have commonly more reſpect to the money of the rich, than to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the poore: and they found it an unſeemely thing, to give to ſome poore maſter of art, or to ſome bachelour or doctor in Theologie, an abbey or biſhoptick

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of ten or twentie thouſand pound a yeare: They thought ſuch fat and pleaſant mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were not for men of baſe qualities, which had not uſed to keepe abbots and biſhops tables in Sorbonne, or other colledges. Therefore that rule of equitie, which wils, that poore &amp; baſe men ſhould not ſoare &amp; mount ſo high, as they might become too rich, and ſo deſtroy and corrupt themſelves, cauſed our maſter of the parliament ſtill to drive away all poore maſters of Art, bachelours, doctors, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiates in Theologie, and in the decrees, from great and fat benefices, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Pragmatick ſanction: but they maintained them to enjoy cures, chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, monachall portions, and other little prebends of ſmall revenue: And ſurely, this equitie of the courts of parliament was great and admirable: For they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that there is nothing that corrupteth more, vertuous men, nor that ſooner cauſeth them to be idle &amp; given to voluptuouſneſſe and other vices, than the great abundance of goods and riches; and that there is nothing more proud than a baſe proud man, which ſuddainly aſcendeth into ſome great degree of honour and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And therefore eſteemed they, that it was more expedient to give the good and rich benefices to noble and rich people, than to this poore and baſe maſters of art, and doctors, Sorbonniſts and Decretiſts: for theſe would but have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and made proud thereby, and the noble and rich men could not have been more corrupted, neither prouder than they were alreadie. But finally, the Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke having been after a ſort practiſed and uſed by the ſpace of thirtie yeares,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> it was quaſhed and aboliſhed by king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh: And a certaine time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond (who in poeſie had before beene another <hi>Ronſard,</hi> and was called alſo <hi>Aeneas Silvius)</hi> utterly condemned to all reproch, that poore prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke ſanction, namely, to bee publickely trailed and drawne through the ſtreets of the towne of Rome, in token and ſigne of irriſion, ignominie, and infamie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of the Counſell that made it, which ſo durſt faſten himſelfe unto the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21818:107"/>
Popes ſanctitie: After ſentence was pronounced, this poore Pragmaticke was

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ignominiouſly drawne through the towne of Rome: And there might you have ſeene all the Dotaries, Bulliſts, Copiſts, and Notaries, about the court of Rome, leape, daunce, laugh, gibe, and mocke at this poore Pragmaticke, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the loſſes and domages which they had by it ſuſtained. And heerein truly the Counſell received a great checke, which made it well appeare to the Pope, That hee was greater maſter than the Counſell, whatſoever our maſters, <hi>Occham, Gingencourt,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gerſon</hi> have ſaid, written &amp; maintained to the contrary, &amp; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all the facultie of Theologie have reſolved, that the Counſell is greater than the Pope.</p>
                  <p>The Pope not onely ſayth he is greater than the Counſell, but alſo, than all the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> kings and emperours of the world, as is prooved by many of the Popes Cannons and Decretals: and therefore, upon this point it is not amiſſe to rehearſe the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, and of an emperour of Conſtantinople, which raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the yeare 1200. This Pope had written certaine letters unto that empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, whereby he rebuked, and ſpoke to him as to his varlet: The emperour made him a modeſt anſwere, ſending him word, That hee was much abaſhed, that hee ſhould write unto him in ſo loftie and imperious a ſtile, and that therein hee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the commandement of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> his predeceſſor, who wils and enjoynes all perſons to obey and be ſubject unto the king, as to the moſt excellent, and unto magiſtrates under him, his deputies: concluding by this place, That the Pope

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ought to acknowledge himſelfe to be ſubject unto the emperour, and not ſo brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeake to him, as to his inferiour. But Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> failed not to frame him this anſwere: <q>Thy imperiall ſublimitie marvelleth that wee durſt rebuke thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt read in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> prince of the Apoſtles, That every man ought to be ſubject unto the king, as to the moſt excellent, and to magiſtrates, by him eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: But thou haſt not well conſidered the perſon of him that ſpeaketh: For the Apoſtle writeth to his ſubjects, That in all humilitie they will yeeld him obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and when he ſayth, To the king, as the moſt excellent; it muſt be underſtood of the temporaltie: for without doubt, the Pope in ſpirituall things is the more excellent, and is ſo much the more to be preferred before kings and emperours, as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the ſoule is to be preferred before the bodie: And if thou haddeſt read that which is written of the ſacerdotall and prieſtly prerogative, thou mighteſt better have knowne this: for it is written, Behold I have appointed thee over nations and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, that thou mayeſt root out, diſſipate, build, and plant: Thou oughteſt alſo further to know, That God hath placed in the firmament of Heaven two great lights, the Sunne to lighten the day, and the Moone to lighten the night: Likewiſe for the firmament of Heaven, that is, for the univerſall Church, God hath made two lights, that is to ſay, two powers, namely, the Papall, which lighteneth the day, and that is ſpirituall things: and the Royall or imperiall, which lighteneth the night, that is to ſay, terrene and earthly things: If then thy imperiall greatneſſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> did well underſtand theſe things, thou ſhouldeſt know as great difference to bee betwixt us and thee, as is betwixt the Sunne and the Moone: and that kings and emperours are ſubject under the Pope, as the Moone is under the Sunne.</q> Behold in ſumme Pope <hi>Innocents</hi> anſwere unto the emperour of Conſtantinople; which containeth a profound Theologicall expoſition, to make flies laugh. About this time there were alſo erected and ſet up in the Church two ſtrong pillars of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:21818:108"/>
Papall power and doctrine; namely, the orders of the begging Friers, and the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Decretals.</p>
                  <p>For the laſt point which we will touch of the Popes power, ſhall bee that which the learned Poet <hi>George Buchanan</hi> ſaith, who ſpeaking of this matter, toucheth the white: for he ſaith, That the ancient governours of Rome (which were kings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, and emperours (have ſubjugated and vanquiſhed both earth and ſea; but that this was nothing, or ſmall in regard of the moderne dominators of Rome, which are the Romane biſhops: For the firſt biſhops of Rome, as S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Clement,</hi> and certaine others by their good and holy life gained heaven and paradice, which is alreadie more than the earth and the ſea, which the old Romanes conquered: But what have the laſt biſhops done, as Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> 
                     <hi>Silvester</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth, <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt the father of <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> above mentioned, and other Popes their like, they have done more than their predeceſſor biſhops, or the ancient kings, emperours, or conſuls of Rome: for they have valiantly conquered hell (ſaith <hi>Buchanan)</hi> and have <note place="margin">Popes have conquered hell.</note> made themſelves maſters and peaceable poſſeſſors thereof, notwithſtanding all the forces and reſiſtance of <hi>Pluto</hi> and all his ſequell, which would not ſuffer, that Popes ſhould dominier in hell, but would only receive them as his vaſſales: But the chance hath happened contrarie; for the Pope is at this day, and hath beene long time, a peaceable dominator and lord of hell, and <hi>Pluto</hi> is no more but his vaſſale, and the ſimple executioner of his commandements, and as it were the gaoler of the Popes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> priſons: inſomuch, as when at this day the Pope diſpatcheth buls of pardons, or croiſadoes (as did Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth in his time) he commandeth the angels of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice to go ſeeke the ſoules of priſoners in hel (after once their ranſome be paid) &amp; <hi>Pluto</hi> and his officers to open their gates, and ſet them at libertie without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, upon paine to looſe their charges and eſtates: And thinke you that <hi>Pluto</hi> durſt diſobey one only word of the Pope his ſoveraigne? It is very certaine, that he durſt not once grunt nor contradict him in any thing, but (all he can poſſible) maintaine his amitie, and to doe him all the ſervices he can.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the pope his father, who commanded the French powers, and made himſelfe feared of all chriſtian princes. For at that time men feared more the popes ſimple buls, than at this day they feare either the keies of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the ſword of S. <hi>Paul</hi> (which hee ſaid hee had) or all his fulminations, excommunications, agravations, reagravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, interdicts, anathematizations, or all the forces and meanes hee can make.

But in the time of <hi>Alexander Borgia,</hi> yea in the time of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the eleaventh his ſucceſſor, all that the Pope would and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was held of chriſtian princes for an ordinance as from the mouth of God, yea, even when the Pope ordained things manifeſtly wicked: as when <hi>Iulius</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a prey, the whole kingdome of France, and the lands of the kings allies. For the king of England, of Arragon, and the emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> beleeved all, that it was a ſufficient cauſe to ſet upon the king and his allies, and that it was even as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement of God. The world then, and even princes, being then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with that beaſtly ſuperſtition and follie, wee neede not bee abaſhed, that <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> had the meanes to poſſeſſe Romania, under the ſhadow and favour of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Pope his father, &amp; that with the aide of the king of France: and it was plainly ſeene, that that good hap to ſubjugate Romania, proceeded from favour, and not from crueltie (as <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith) becauſe as ſoone as that favour ceaſed, all his caſe was overthrowne, and it was ſtraight ſeene, that his utter ruine arived, as is ſaid.

                  <p>For proofe heereof reaſons are cleare and manifeſt: for wee call crueltie, all exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which are committed upon men, their lands and goods, without any forme

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of juſtice, or againſt all right and equitie: heereupon it followeth, that as violence is directly contrarie to right and equitie, ſo alſo is crueltie, and that crueltie is no other thing but manifeſt violence. But according to the Maximes, even of philoſophers, <hi>No violent thing can endure;</hi> So it followeth, that an eſtate founded upon cruelty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long endure. Moreover crueltie is alwaies hated of every one; for although it bee not practiſed upon all particulars, but upon ſome onely; yet they upon whom it is not exerciſed, ceaſe not to feare, when they ſee it executed upon their parents, friends allies and neighbours: But the feare of paine and puniſhment, engendreth hatred; for one can never love that, whereof hee feares to receive evill, eſpeciallie when there is a feare of life, loſſe of goods and honours, which are the things wee hold moſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> precious: and of that which wee hate, wee by the ſame meanes deſire the loſſe and entier ruine, and ſearch out, procure and advance it with all our power. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible when all a people ſhooteth at one ſame marke, that a tyrant or cruell prince (for all is one) can long endure, or that hee can doe ſo much, as there ſhall not arive unto him, ſome diſaſtre or evill fortune: And if ſometimes it pleaſe God to ſuffer him to live long, it is to cauſe him to take the higher leap, that in the end hee may have the ſorer fall: As wee ſee it well painted in poets tragoedies, where many tyrants are ſeene (which enduring long time, have done no other thing during the ſpace of their life, but knit cordes, faſten gallowes in ſome imminent places, whet ſwords and dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, &amp; temper poiſons) for afterward to drinke the poiſon, to ſtab the dagger in their boſomes, or hang themſelves on the gibet, in the ſight of all the world; which laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mocking them, ſay, it is well employed: &amp; we muſt not ſay, that ſuch tragoe. dies are but poeticall fictions; for hyſtories are full of ſuch tragicall ends of tyrants, which have delighted to ſhed their ſubjects bloud, and to handle them cruellie. <note place="margin">Cruell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note>

by them, never happened in a generous and valiant heart, but rather alwaies in

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cowardly and fearefull hearts. Therfore when one day, one advertiſed the emperour <hi>Mauricius,</hi> that the captaine <hi>Phocas</hi> entended and wrought evill againſt him; and another maintained that he was but a coward, and too fearefull to bring any thing to paſſe: the emperour <hi>Mauricius</hi> anſwered, <q>So much the more ought I to take heed: for thoſe cowardly and fearefull people, when they enterpriſe a crueltie, and that they have advantage, they can never hold any meaſure therein.</q> And this vice of crueltie (ſaith <hi>Marcellinus)</hi> may be called the ulcer of the ſoule, proceeding of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amian. Mar. lib.</hi> 27.</note> feebleneſſe of the mind, and cowardiſe of the heart: And therefore ſicke and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people are more chollericke than they that are in health, and miſerable and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate men, more than they which are at their eaſe and contented. And hereupon

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> (ſaith <hi>Marcellinus)</hi> that the cauſe why <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a cruell man, came becauſe of the choller, which ſo ruled in him, that as ſoone as any ſpoke unto him any word that diſpleaſed him, he changed colour, voice, and gate, and could not commaund himſelfe, nor keepe from committing many cruelties and injuſtices, his judgement was ſo with choller oppreſſed. Finally, it was the cauſe of his death: For one day the Quadians demanded peace of him, and by their embaſſadors excuſing themſelves of a rebellion, he began to ſpeak to thoſe embaſſadors in ſo great anger, rehearſing his kindneſſe &amp; humanitie before uſed unto them, that at once his voice and words failed him, as if he had been ſtrucken with a deadly blow, and withall begun to ſend out a mortall ſweat: he was incontinent carried to a chamber, and laid upon a bed,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and by the advice of one of his phyſicians, a veine was opened, but it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to draw a drop of blood out, the ſaid choller had ſo burned and dried his inward parts: ſo he died. A notable example, for princes to take that conſideration of their health, that they never ſuffer choller nor crueltie to abide in them: for ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions once taking an habit in them, they burne &amp; roſt their entrailes, and ſo will not ſuffer them to live long. But they ought further to conſider, that ſuch vices alſo doe ſoile and defile the reputation of that generoſitie and magnanimitie that ought to be in a prince: For we have ſeene, and doe ordinarily ſee, that chollericke and cruell men have almoſt alwayes been and are cowards and fearefull, but generous and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men are gentle and full of humanitie. Princes ought further to conſider, that if

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they be once ſpotted with crueltie, they never make good end; and God will have it ſo: becauſe he that committeth crueltie, violateth the divine law, which forbiddeth to ſhed mans bloud, and to ſley, but by forme of juſtice: He alſo violateth the law of nature; for he deſtroyeth his like, which nature hath produced, and which hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that inſtinct even to brute beaſts, not to deſtroy beaſts of their own kind; there is alſo a precept of the law of nature, not to offend another: Hee likewiſe violateth the civile law, whereby is forbidden all murder and homicide, upon paine of death: Is it then any marveile, if ſanguinarie and bloodie princes have commonly evill ends, ſeeing they violate the divine, naturall, and civile lawes, approved of all people and nations.

Another time he cauſed to ordaine and place his battaile ſtrong and in good order to fight, and commanded that every one ſhould march in his ranke, and that al their artillerie and all other furniture for an aſſault, ſhould be prepared for a ready fight, yet no man knew his intent what hee would doe: When his armie had marched in order of battaile to the ſhore of the great Ocean ſea (which was nigh) hee then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded al his ſouldiers and men of warre to fiſh, &amp; gather into their hoſe, boſomes,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> themſelves well, whileſt he played upon the citheron amongſt ſingers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon players of enterludes. His death was ſtrange: For being abandoned of all the world, but of ſome four or five ſervants, he ſought to hide himſelfe in a litle houſe of pleaſure in the fields, which appertained to <hi>Phaon,</hi> one whom he had enfranchiſed: being there, his men preſſed him to ſlay himſelfe quickly, leaſt he fell alive into the hands of his enemies: for none of them would doe him the pleaſure, as to ſlay him: Then he commanded them to make for him a grave, and laid him downe upon the earth for a meaſure thereof: but whileſt they were making of the grave, behold a lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey of <hi>Phaons</hi> came, who brought a decree from the Senat, whereby <hi>Nero</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared an enemie of the Commonwealth, with commandement to ſeeke him out,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> &amp; to puniſh him as a publick enemie: After he had read this decree, he took his two daggers, and proved whether they both were ſharpe ynough: after, hee put them in the ſheath, ſaying his houre was not yet come: yet ſtraight hee prayed his men, that they would begin a little to weep &amp; lament. Soon after, he deſired, that ſome of them would ſhew him by example how hee ſhould ſley himſelfe: But perceiving knights arriving, and doubting they came to take him, hee gave himſelfe a ſtroke with his

A thing alſo worthie it is to be marked, that at his laſt ſigh hee complained, that none kept faith with him, with him I ſay, that was full of all diſloyaltie: And wherfore ſhould they? do tyrants think, that men will keepe faith with them, ſeeing they themſelves breake it with every one: If they ſo thinke, they are deceived: For to abandon a tyrant, and not any way to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, is to obſerve faith to his countrey and to the Commonweale.

Sir, anſwered he, I find by art, I ſhall be eaten with dogs: Well (replied <hi>Domitian)</hi> I will keepe thee well from that adventure: and ſtraight to convince him of a lie, he commanded him to be ſlain, &amp; to be buried, &amp; after, his body to be burnt into aſhes,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> according as the Romanes uſed to burie their dead: But it happened after hee was ſlaine, as they thought to have burnt his bodie into aſhes, in a publicke place, the fire being lighted to burne the body, there ſuddenly aroſe a great tempeſt, which ejected the bodie (halfe burnt) out of the fire, which incontinent was torne in pieces and eaten of dogs. This beeing reported to <hi>Domitian,</hi> hee was much afraid of this hap: So that as well, for that <hi>Aſcletarion</hi> had ſaid unto him, as for that other diviners had told him the day and houre he ſhould be ſlaine, he thought it good to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his guard: and the better to ſee them which came behind him, he cauſed to floore all his gallerie (where he moſt often walked) with a kind of ſhining ſtone, from which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> as in a glaſſe there proceeded ſuch a brightneſſe, as hee might eaſily ſee whatſoever was behind him. The foretold-day being come, and the houre approching (which was five) he asked what of the clocke it was: one expreſſely anſwered him that it was ſix of the clocke, to aſſure him that the danger was paſt: but about that houre of five there knocked at his chamber dore one <hi>Stephanus</hi> his chamberlaine (who was one of the conſpirators againſt him) his left arme hanging in a ſcarfe, as if it had been hurt, ſignifying to him that he would declare the conjuration entended againſt him.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> a poinard in his bellie: wounded as he was, he would faine have revenged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but his other houſhold ſervants entered to maſſacre him, giving him ſeven mortall wounds. Behold an admirable example to ſhew, that there is no prudence nor humane foreſight, that can hinder that the judgements of God be not executed upon tyrants. But if any demand, how diviners and aſtrologers could ſo juſtly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the death of the emperour <hi>Domitian:</hi> I anſwere, that we muſt beleeve, that this ſaid prediction was not by art or ſcience: but the evill ſpirit would give boldneſſe of enterpriſing, unto <hi>Domitians</hi> enemies, in making them know by frivolous divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his fatall houre, that they might beleeve, the ſtarres and heaven, to aid their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> As ſoone as the king <hi>Alphonſus</hi> was dead, and <hi>Ferrand</hi> his ſonne was king; the firſt thing hee did at his comming to the crowne, was to maſſacre all thoſe ſaid great princes and barons (which he himſelfe had impriſoned, during his fathers life) by a Moorean ſlave of Affrica, which he rewarded, and ſtraight after the execution ſent him into his countrey.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> there was no fidelitie in the <hi>Arragonian</hi> race of Naples, would enter into no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the king <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who being in diſpaire to be ever able to hold that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome againſt the king of Fraunce, having his owne ſubjects his enemies, died for ſorrow and diſpaire, and left his ſonne <hi>Alphonſus</hi> his ſucceſſor. This <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the new king was as wicked as his father, and had alwayes ſhewed himſelfe pittileſſe and cruell, without faith, without religion, and without all humanitie; inſomuch, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that king <hi>Charles</hi> approched Rome, his conſcience alſo judging himſelfe to be an unworthy king, he reſolved to flie into Spain, and to profeſſe himſelfe a monke in ſome monaſterie: But before hee fled, hee cauſed to be crowned king at Naples a young ſonne of his, called <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was not yet hated in the countrey, his

But it was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous that this cruel tyrant ſhould be ſo ſeized of feare, as he ſhould go in no good order away, but left all his moveable goods, and almoſt all his gold and ſilver in his caſtle at Naples: And this feare proceeded to him from a faintneſſe of heart; for (as <hi>Comines</hi> ſaith) never cruell man was hardie: And when one deſired him onely to ſtay three dayes to packe up his goods: No no (ſaid he) let us quickly depart from hence, heare you not all the world crie Fraunce, Fraunce?

In the meane while, <hi>Henry</hi> the baſtard, gathered a new army with the help of the king of France, which was conducted by the ſaid <hi>Meſsier Bertrand</hi> of Gueſclin, and unlooked for, they gave an aſſault (nigh unto Montiell in Caſtile) to

                  <p>By the aboveſaid examples it ſeemes unto mee, That a prince may eaſely judge (if hee be of any judgement) how pernitious and damnable the doctrine of <hi>Machiavell</hi> is, to enſtruct a prince to bee cruell: for it is impoſſible that a cruell prince ſhould

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> long raigne, but we ordinarily ſee that the vengeance of God (yea by violent meanes) followeth pace by pace, crueltie. <hi>Machiavell</hi> for confirmation of his doctrine alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the example of the emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> who indeede was a man very cruell and ſanguinarie, yet raigned eighteene yeeres, or there abouts, and dyed in his bed. But unto this I anſwere that the cruelties of <hi>Severus</hi> ſeeme to bee ſomething excuſable, becauſe that he had for competitors in the empire <hi>Albinus</hi> and <hi>Niger,</hi> two of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nobilitie than hee, and which had more friends: Inſomuch as it ſeemed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for him (to weaken the two competitors, and to withſtand their friends from hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him) to uſe that crueltie to kill them; Yet hee pardoned many Albinians, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled himſelfe unto them: moreover hee exerciſed part of his cruelties, in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> revenge of the good emperour <hi>Pertinax,</hi> which was a lawfull cauſe; yet withall had he in himſelfe many goodly and laudable vertues, as wee have in other places rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: ſo that, as his crueltie made him much hated, his other vertues wrought ſome mitigation thereof. Laſtly, hee made no other end, than other cruell princes: for hee dyed with ſorrow (as ſaith <hi>Herodian</hi> who was in his time) for that hee ſaw his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:21818:113"/>
to kill his father, who yet did pardon him: But <hi>Baſsianus</hi> pardoned not

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> his fathers phiſitions, which would nor obey him, when hee commanded them to poiſon his ſicke father; for as ſoone as his father was dead hee hanged and ſtrangled them all. Heerein alſo God puniſhed the crueltie of <hi>Severus,</hi> that having exerciſed all theſe cruelties and ſlaughters, well to eſtabliſh the empire in his houſe, hee was fruſtrated of his intention: For of thoſe two ſonnes <hi>Baſsianus</hi> and <hi>Geta,</hi> one ſlew the other; and <hi>Baſsianus</hi> after he had ſlaine <hi>Geta,</hi> endured not long, but was ſlaine by <hi>Macrinus,</hi> and left behind him no children. Therefore although it ſeemed that God ſpared to puniſh <hi>Severus</hi> crueltie, for his other good vertues, yet remained not hee unpuniſhed; for ſeeing his ſonne (who had learned of him to bee cruell) durſt enterpriſe to ſlay him, hee dyed of griefe and ſorrow: And wee neede not doubt but

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> his conſcience aſſaulted him greatly; for he might well thinke, that it was a juſt divine vengeance, to ſee himſelfe ſo cruelly aſſaulted by his owne blood, and to ſee machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated againſt himſelfe, by his owne ſonne, the like crueltie which hee exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, yet he diſſembled this &amp; pardoned his ſonne: For how durſt he puniſh that vice, that hee had learned him? therefore this example of <hi>Severus</hi> ſerveth little or nothing to maintaine the doctrine of <hi>Machiavell;</hi> neither is one example ſo conſiderable againſt a million of others contrary: for men muſt make a law of that which happeneth moſt often, and in many examples, not of that which ſeldome happeneth.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> offences as are done againſt him. There are yet other obligations, that is, That the king hath done much good &amp; honour to my lord of Bourgoigne: For it pleaſed him, that <hi>Monſeignior le Daulphin</hi> ſhould eſpouſe his daughter, &amp; that the ſon of my ſaid lord of Bourgoigne, ſhould marry madame <hi>Michelle</hi> daughter to his royall majeſty; and as S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cum creſcunt dona, creſcunt rationes donorum,</hi> that is, when gifts encreaſe, ſo doe their obligations alſo. All theſe obligations are cauſe that my lord of Bourgoigne hath cauſed to ſlay the duke of Orleance lately dead, which act was perpetrated for the very great good of the kings perſon, of his children, and of all the realme, as I ſhall ſo ſufficiently ſhew, as every man ſhall bee ſatiſfied: For the ſaid <hi>Monſeignior</hi> of Bourgoigne, hath charged me by expreſſe commandement

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to propoſe his juſtification, which thing I durſt not denie, for two cauſes: The firſt becauſe I am bound to ſerve him, by an oth taken of mee three yeeres agoe: The ſecond, becauſe hee hath given mee a good and great portion, every yeere to keepe mee at ſchole, becauſe hee conſidered I was ſmally benificed, which penſion did mee great good towards my expences, and yet will ſo doe mee long, if it pleaſe God and my ſaid lord of Bourgoigne. But when I conſider the great matter I have taken in hand to handle before this noble companie, great feare troubleth my heart: for I know I am of ſmall ſenſe, feeble of ſpirit, and of a poore memorie, ſo that my tongue and memory flieth away, and that ſmall ſence I was wont to have, hath now altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left mee, ſo that I ſee no other remedie, but to commend mee to my God and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> creator, and to his glorious mother, &amp; to <hi>Monſeigneur</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt prince of Theologians: And therefore I humbly beſeech you, my moſt redoubted lords, &amp; all this companie, if I ſay any thing which is not well ſaid, to attribute it to my ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſſe and ignorance; that I may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Ignorans feci ideoque miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recordiam conſecutus ſum,</hi> that is, I did it of ignorance and therefore am I pardoned. But ſome may here make a queſtion, ſaying, It appertaineth not to a Theologian to make the ſaid juſtification, but rather to a juriſt: I anſwer, That then it belongeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me, which am neither the one nor the other, but a poore ignorant man, as I have ſayd, whoſe ſence and memorie faileth: yet a man may ſay and maintaine it, That it well belongeth to a doctor in Theologie, to defend his maſter, and to ſay and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> preach the truth. Men need not then be abaſhed if I lend my pore tongue to my lord and maiſter who hath nouriſhed me: For it is now in his great need that I lend him my tongue; &amp; they that love me the leſſe for it, I thinke they commit a great ſinne, and hereof every man of reaſon will excuſe me: Then to begin this Iuſtification, I take my theame upon that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Radix omnium maloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cupidit as, quam quidam appetentes, erraverunt à fide.</hi> Theſe words are in the firſt to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the ſixt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21818:114"/>
chapter, and are thus engliſhed: Ladie Covetouſneſſe of all evils is the root, which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> makes men diſloyall. Some may object to me, that pride is the firſt of all ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Lucifer</hi> by his pride, fell from Paradice into hell; and alſo becauſe it is ſaid in <hi>Eccleſiasticus,</hi> chap. 10. <hi>Initium omnis peccati, ſuperbia:</hi> that is, Pride is the beginning and root of all ſinne. All men may then argue from this place; Then is not dame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe: But the anſwere hereunto is, that there are three manner of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that is, of Honor, of Riches, and of Carnall delectation: but the firſt kind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth pride, <hi>ergo, &amp;c.</hi> This covetouſneſſe alſo of honor, comprehendeth vain-glorie, wrath, hatred, envie; inſomuch, as hee that is ſpotted with this kind of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, is enflamed with vaine-glorie, and angrie againſt his lord, whoſe place and domination he would gladly occupie, and moreover hateth and envieth him: And

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> al theſe crimes together, which proceed from covetouſneſſe, when they are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt his prince, are called, Treaſon, which is the greateſt crime that can bee. Thus much for the firſt point of my theme, That dame Covetouſneſſe is the root of all evils. The ſecond point is, That ſhe maketh them become diſloyall: for with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to dominier, they enterpriſe againſt their lord, whereas they ſhould be loiall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter by many goodly places. But as is fit; to ſhew my lord of Bourgoignes juſtification, I will take that place of dame Covetouſneſſe, which I have alleadged for my Major, and after I will come to my Minor, and ſo to the Concluſion.</q>

                     <q>For proofe then of my Maior, I wil note and propoſe eight principall Verities, by

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> manner of a foundation, out of which I will inferre eight Concluſions, as it were correlatives, the better to ground the juſtification of <hi>Monſieur de</hi> Bourgoigne. The firſt Veritie is, That every ſubject and vaſſale, which upon covetouſneſſe enterpriſeth againſt the corporall health of his king and ſoveraigne lord, to take away his moſt noble ſeignorie, committeth the horrible crime of treaſon, and is worthie of double death, that is, of the firſt and of the ſecond. I prove it, becauſe every diſloyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and vaſſale againſt his ſoveraigne, ſinneth mortally. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo I prove it by S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who ſayth thus: <hi>Tyrannus est proprie qui non Dominus reputatur, non iuſte principatur, aut non principatu decoratur:</hi> That hee is a tyrant, which is not the true Lord, or which ruleth not juſtly, or which is not honoured by his principalitie. Alſo

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I prove it by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt, who ſaith: <hi>Qui vivit non morietur nec laedetur à morte ſecunda:</hi> that is to ſay, That he that ſhall have victorie upon lady Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and her three daughters, Ire, Hatred, and Envie, ſhall not need to feare the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, namely, eternall damnation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The ſecond Veritie is, that in the aforeſaid caſe, wherein the ſubject or vaſſale is worthie of double death; yet the vaſſale is more to be puniſhed than the ſimple ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and a baron more than a ſimple vaſſale; and a countie more than a baron; and a duke more than a countie; and a kings allie more than a ſtranger. I prove it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the obligation of a duke or the kings kinſman towards the king, is by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees greater than of a countie, baron, or of a vaſſale: <hi>Ergo,</hi> then the puniſhment muſt be in an higher degree: And that my conſequence is good, I prove it, becauſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the degrees of obligations and prerogatives doe correſpond and fully anſwer to the degrees of the puniſhment, and ſo as they are greater, ſo ought the puniſhment to be greater, as I have before alledged out of S. <hi>Gregorie: Cum creſcunt dona, creſcunt rationes donorum.</hi> As gifts encreaſe, ſo ought the reaſons of gifts (that is obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to doe: I prove alſo my ſaid Veritie by another argument. It is a greater ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21818:114"/>
that a duke or the kings allie ſhould goe about to take away the kings ſeigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> than if it were a poore ſubject: <hi>Ergo</hi> then, the puniſhment ought to bee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing the ſcandale is greater. Thirdly, I prove my ſaid Veritie, becauſe there is a greater perill of a great man than of a little; therefore the remedie of puniſhment ought to be greater to withdraw great men from yeelding and obeying the enemie of mankind, and dame Covetouſneſſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The third Veritie is, That in the caſe aforeſaid, when the vaſſale committeth trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, meriting double death, then is it lawfull for every ſubject, according to the lawes morall, naturall, and divine, to kill without any command that traitour and diſloyall tyrant; and it is not onely lawfull, but alſo honourable and meritorious. I prove this veritie by twelve reaſons in the honour of holy Theologie: The firſt, of a doctor,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which upon the ſecond booke of the maſter of Sentences, ſayth: <hi>Qui ad liberatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem patriae, tyrannum occidit praemium accipit, &amp; facit opus laudabile &amp; meritorium.</hi> That is: He which ſleyeth a tyrant, to deliver his countrey, receiveth a reward, and doth a laudable and a meritorious worke. The ſecond authoritie is taken out of that excellent doctor <hi>Salceber</hi> in his book of Policraton, who ſaith: <hi>Amico adulari non li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, ſedaurem Tyranni mulcere licitum eſt, quia ei licet adulari quem licet occidere:</hi> that is: It is not lawfull for any to flatter his friend, but with faire words he may wel bring a tyrant aſleepe, for it is lawfull to kill him. The third authoritie is of many doctors in Theologie, all which I ſet downe but for one, that I may not exceede the number of three, namely, of <hi>Richard de Mivile, Alexander de Halles,</hi> and <hi>Astenſis,</hi> which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hold the foreſaid concluſion: And for a greater confirmation, I adde hereunto the authoritie of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſayth: <hi>Subditi estote Regi quaſi praecellenti:</hi> that is, Let each man obey his king, as the moſt excellent and ſoveraign. My three ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the twelve, are founded upon the authoritie of three morrall philoſophers. The firſt, <hi>Licitum &amp; laudabile est cuilibet ſubditorum occidere tyrannum:</hi> that is, It is lawfull &amp; praiſeworthie for every man to ſley a tyrant. The ſecond authoritie is from the noble moralliſt <hi>Tully,</hi> who ſayth in his Offices, That they which killed <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> were worthie of praiſe, becauſe he had uſurped the ſeignorie of Rome by tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. The third authoritie is out of <hi>Boccace,</hi> who ſayth: That men may well conſpire and employ armes againſt a tyrant; and that it is a thing moſt holy and neceſſarie,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that a tyrant ought not to be called, king nor prince, and that there cannot be a more pleaſanter ſacrifice, than the bloud of a tyrant. After theſe authorities alledged out of Theologians and Moraliſts, I come now to the authoritie of Legiſts: And becauſe I am not a Lawyer, it ſufficieth me to ſpeake the ſentence of the lawes, without alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them: for in all my life I never ſtudied the cannon and civile law but two years, and that was twentie yeares agoe, ſo that I could learne but a little, and might eaſily forget that little by the length of time, ſince I learned it. The firſt authoritie out of the civile law, is, That it is lawfull to kill forſakers of knighthood: but who can more forſake knighthood, than he which forſakes his king, who is the chiefe of all knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? The ſecond authoritie is, That it is lawfull to kill theeves and robbers by high

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> wayes: It is lawfull then to kill a tyrant, which continually watcheth and intendeth the death of his ſoveraigne lord. I come now to three authorities of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The firſt is that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who without authoritie ſlew the Aegyptian: who ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over the people of Irael: For at that time <hi>Moſes</hi> had not the authoritie of a judge over the people of Iſrael, which was delivered unto him nigh fortie yeares after that he had ſlaine the Aegyptian. The ſecond authoritie is the example of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:21818:115"/>
who without any commandement ſlew the duke <hi>Zambry,</hi> becauſe he allied him

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſelfe by carnall love with a Sarracene woman; whereupon <hi>Phineas</hi> was commended and reverenced in three things, in love, honour, and riches. The third authoritie is that of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the archangell, who without the commandement of God or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, fought againſt the tyrant <hi>Lucifer,</hi> ſo diſloyall to God his ſoveraigne, who went about to uſurpe the ſeignorie of God: The ſaid S. <hi>Michael</hi> was favourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in three things, that is, in honour, love, and riches: in love, becauſe God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him more than any other Angell: in honour, becauſe God made him a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prince of the heavenly hoaſt: in riches, becauſe God gave him riches as much as he deſired or could carrie away: ſo it appeareth, that my third Veritie is well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by twelve reaſons, in the name of the twelve Apoſtles: of which reaſons, three are taken from the holy Theologians, three from Moraliſts, and three from Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and the three laſt from the holy Scripture, and they goe alwaies from three to three.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My fourth Veritie is this: It is more meritorious and honourable, that a tyrant be ſlaine by the kings parents, than by a ſtranger; and by a duke, than by a countie; and by a barron, than by a ſimple vaſſale; becauſe therein ſhineth more the love &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſleyer, and is more honourable to the king to be revenged of a great man, than a baſe and meane man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My fift Veritie is: That alliances, promiſes, othes, or confederations ought not to be kept, if for keeping them, there come any prejudice to the prince or to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but to keep them, is to do againſt the morall, naturall, and divine lawes. I proove this Veritie by thus arguing: Whenſoever two contrarie obligations are concurrent, a man muſt keepe and obſerve the greateſt, and breake the leaſt: But in this caſe, the bond unto the prince and commonwealth is greater than any other promiſe or conſideration: <hi>Ergo</hi> then wee muſt obſerve the obligation towards the prince and commonwealth, and breake all other obligations, othes, and confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Alſo in arguing thus: Whenſoever a man doth a thing better than that which he ſweares to do, he is not perjured in doing that better thing, &amp; omitting that thing which he ſwore to doe (as expreſſely the maſter ſaith of Sentences in the laſt of the third) but in this propounded caſe, it is better to kill a tyrant, although a man have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſworne not to kill him, than to let him live, as hath been above ſhewed: <hi>Ergo</hi> then it is no perjurie nor evill done, to ſley a tyrant againſt his ſworne promiſe, alliance, or confederation that he hath with him. Alſo <hi>Iſiodorus</hi> in his booke of ſoveraigne good ſayth, That wee muſt not obſerve an oth, whereby a man ſhall bee forced raſhly to commit an evill: but in our caſe a man ſhall bee forced to an evill by ſuch a promiſe and oth: <hi>Ergo</hi> he muſt then not obſerve it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The ſixt Veritie is: That if ſo it happen, that the alliances, othes, or confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, turne to the prejudice of one of the promiſers, hee is in nothing bound to keep them. This veritie is prooved in thus arguing: The end of every commaundement is charitie, as the Apoſtle ſaith: but the cheefe charitie beginneth at our ſelves: <hi>Ergo</hi> the commandement to obſerve the faith and promiſe, ought not to bee obſerved, if

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> it be contrarie to the charitie, which we ought to have towards our ſelves, according to that which is ſaid of the Cannoniſts: <hi>Frangenti fidem, fides frangatur eidem:</hi> Hee that breakes faith, faith ought to be broken to him againe: Alſo in all promiſes that are made, every man muſt include, If it pleaſe God: But certaine it is, it pleaſeth not God, that we ſhould do any thing againſt the law and order of charitie: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:21818:115"/>
                  <p>
                     <q>The ſeventh Veritie is: That to every ſubject it is lawfull, honourable, and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to kill a tyrant by deceits, ſpeculations and diſſimulations. I proove it firſt by the authoritie of the morall philoſopher <hi>Boccace</hi> above alledged: Alſo by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of king <hi>Iehu,</hi> who diſſembled to approve the ſervice of <hi>Baal,</hi> to trap the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, for which he was praiſed: Alſo by the example of <hi>Ioiada,</hi> who by treaſon cauſed <hi>Athalia</hi> to be ſlaine, for which he was praiſed: Alſo of <hi>Iudith,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Holofernes</hi> by diſſimulation, whereupon ſhe is praiſed: And this is the fitteſt death for tyrants to die on, that is, to be ſlaine villanouſly by watchings and eſpiements.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The eight Truth is: That every ſubject which enterpriſeth and worketh againſt his ſoveraigne lord by Necromancie and invocation of devils for covetouſneſſe to have the crowne, is a violator of the Catholicke faith, and worthie of double death,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the firſt and the ſecond: For S. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> (in his ſecond book, Diſtinction the ſixt) ſaith, That the divell never pleaſeth the will of ſuch men, but firſt idolatrie and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie are mingled together: For as faith ſerveth much to the operation of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, ſo infidelitie is as requiſit in the operation of divelliſh things: The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell alſo will doe nothing for ſuch men, unleſſe they agree to yeeld him the domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over them, whereof he is very deſirous: Alſo that great doctor in the ninth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, in <hi>Secunda Secundae,</hi> ſaith and affirmeth, That invocations of devils never come to effect without a fore-going of a corruption of faith, idolatrie, and an expreſſe compact with divels. And this opinion doe the venerable doctors, <hi>Alexander de Hales, Richard de Mivile,</hi> and <hi>Astenſis</hi> hold, and commonly all the other doctours

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which have writ of this matter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Here you ſee my eight Verities well proved: I come now to eight Correlatives. The firſt is: If it come to paſſe, that in the caſe aforeſaid, theſe invocators of devils and traito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o the king be impriſoned, and ſome of their partakers deliver or cauſe to deliver them hee ought to bee puniſhed with the ſame puniſhment as they are themſelves, namely, with the firſt and ſecond death. Secondly, every ſubject that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a bargaine with any man to empoyſon his ſoveraigne lord, although the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe come not to effect, is alſo well worthie of death. Thirdly, every ſubject that by diſſimulation of paſtime cauſeth apparrell to be made to put on his ſoveraigne lord, and to put fire therein, thinking to burne him, is alſo worthie of double death.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Fourthly, every ſubject making alliance with the mortall enemies of the king &amp; the kingdome, is alſo worthie of death. Fiftly, every ſubject which fraudulently ſetteth diſſention betwixt the king and the queene, making the queene underſtand that the king hateth her, and counſelling her to goe out of the realme, ſhe and her children, offering ſafely to conduct her out, is worthie of the like death, as above. Sixtly, every ſubject that giveth the Pope to underſtand falſe things, as to make him underſtand, that his king and lord is not worthie to hold the crowne, nor his children after him, is worthy of like death. Seventhly, the tyrant that hindereth the union of the church and the deliberations of the Cleargie, for the utilitie of the holy mother Church, ought to be puniſhed as an hereticke and ſchiſmaticke, and meriteth, that the earth

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhould open and ſwallowe him, as <hi>Dathan, Core,</hi> and <hi>Abiron.</hi> Eightly, the ſubject which by empoyſonments and viands, ſeekes to cauſe the king or his children to die, is worthie of the aforeſaid death. The laſt is, that every ſubject, which with ſouldiers cauſeth the people and countrey of his ſoveraigne to bee eaten up and exiled, and which taketh and diſtributeth his money at his pleaſure, and makes it ſerve his turne to procure alliances with his lords enemies, ought to be puniſhed as a very tyrant
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21818:116"/>
with the firſt and ſecond death. And here I make an end of my Maior of the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the duke of Bourgoigne.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But I come now to declare my Minor, wherin I have ſhewed, That <hi>Lewis</hi> late duke of Orleance, was ſo much embraced with ladie Covetouſneſſe, of the honours and riches of this world, that hee would have taken away the ſeignorie and crowne of Fraunce, from the king his brother and his children, by temptation of the enemie of hell, uſing the aforeſaid meanes: for he found an Apoſtata monke, expert in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velliſh art, unto whom he gave a ring and a ſword, to conſecrate them to the divell: This monke went into a ſolitarie place, behind a buſh, where he put off all his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his ſhirt, and fell on his knees, ſo invocating devils: Straight there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two devils, apparelled in darke greene, whereof the one was called <hi>Hernias,</hi> and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the other <hi>Estramain:</hi> Then this monke did unto them as great reverence &amp; honour as he could doe to God our Saviour: and one of the devils tooke the ring, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſword, and after vaniſhed away; the monke went away alſo. Hee returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place againe, and there found the ring, having a red colour, and the ſword, wherewith he thought to have ſlaine the king: but by the helpe of God, and of the moſt excellent ladies of Berry and Bourgoigne, the king eſcaped. Alſo the ſaid duke of Orleance made an alliance and confederation with the duke of Lancaſter, who in like manner warred againſt king <hi>Richard</hi> of England his lord, as is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. <hi>Item,</hi> He went about to have carried away the queene and her children, which hee meant to have carried into the countie of Luxembrough, to take his will of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> her, which the queene would not agree to. <hi>Item,</hi> Hee practiſed to make <hi>Monſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior le Daulphin</hi> eat an impoyſoned apple, which was given to a child, who was charged to give it to none but to the ſaid Daulphin: but it ſo happened, that the child gave it to one of the ſonnes of the ſaid duke of Orleance, who di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d thereof. <hi>Item,</hi> The ſaid duke hath alwayes favoured the Pope in the extraction of money out of the kingdome, to obtaine of him a declaration againſt the king and his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of inhabilitie to hold the kingdome, and to give it unto him. <hi>Item,</hi> He hath held armed men in the fields by the ſpace of 14 or 15 yeares, which did nothing but pill, exile, rob, ranſack, and ſley the poore people, and force women and maids. <hi>Item,</hi> He laid tallages upon the kings ſubjects, and emploied the ſilver in making alliances

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with our enemies, to come to the crowne, and beſides hee hath committed many great crimes, which my ſaid <hi>Monſeignior le</hi> Bourgoigne, reſerveth to declare in time and place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It followeth then by good conſequence, that my ſaid lord of Bourgoigne <note place="margin">Concluſion</note> ought not to be blamed for ſleying the ſaid duke of Orleance, and that the king ſhould like that deed well, and to authorize the ſame as much as were needfull: And beſides, he ought to be rewarded in three eſpeciall things, that is, in Love, Honour, and Riches, as were S. <hi>Michaell</hi> the archangell, and the moſt valiant <hi>Phineas:</hi> that is to ſay (as I thinke in my groſſe and rude underſtanding) That the king our lord ought more than before to beare amitie, loyaltie, and good repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to my ſaid lord of Bourgoigne, and to cauſe to be publiſhed letters patents through all the realme. God graunt it may bee ſo, who bee bleſſed world without end. Amen.</q>

                  <p>Here is in ſubſtance the Oration of that venerable doctor in Theologie, unto which I have not added one word, onely I have ſhortened certaine long and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated allegations, whereby might be ſeene the beaſtlineſſe of this our maſter, a man
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21818:116"/>
hired to juſtifie one of the moſt execrable murders that ever was committed. Very

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> notable is the rhethoricke and art of this venerable doctors Oration: which in the Exordium or beginning to obtaine benevolence, confeſſeth, that he is an ignorant man, without ſence or memorie: And to make a reaſon why hee hath enterpriſed to be in theſe cauſes advocate, he ſaith it is for a penſion, which the duke of Burgoigne gave him towards his living: After for proofe of his Maior, he alleadgeth places of Scripture ſo evill applied, as children at this day will diſcover his follie: And for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table authors he alledgeth a ſort of ſottiſh ſcholaſticall ſophiſters of Theologie, as <hi>Alexander de Hales, Salceber, Mivile,</hi> and other like. His Correlatives and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, are the falſe imputations wherewith the duke of Bourgoigne charged the duke of Orleance. Moreover, this Oration was reviewed by the maſters of the facultie of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Sorbonne, with the biſhop of Paris, and the Inquiſitor of faith, and there were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereſies theſe propoſitions following. Every tyrant may be ſlaine by his vaſſale and ſubject, without commandement of juſtice. Secondly, S. <hi>Michael</hi> ſlew <hi>Lucifer</hi> without Gods commandement. Thirdly, <hi>Phineas</hi> killed <hi>Zambry</hi> without the commandement of God. Fourthly, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſlew the Egyptian without the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God. Fifthly, <hi>Iudith</hi> ſinned not in flattering <hi>Holofernes,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn</hi> in lying, that he would honour <hi>Baal.</hi> Sixtly, it is not alwaies perjurie, when a man dooth that, which he hath ſworne not to doe. Which articles having been declared hereticall, they were condemned to be burnt publickely, as alſo <hi>M. Iohn Petits</hi> bones, who had maintained them (for he was at this judgement dead and buried at Heſdin) and the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſaid articles were executed and put into the fire, but not the doctors bones, for they could not be gotten, becauſe the duke of Bourgoigne then held Heſdin.</p>
                  <p>Surely it is a ſtrange thing and very deplorable, that there ſhould be any ſuch men in the world, which durſt maintaine with reaſons ſo horrible a crime farre from all common ſence, and all reaſon and humanitie, as is a maſſacre done and executed practiſedly, without any forme of juſtice. Is not this to call things with contrarie names, that is, to call injuſtice, by the name of juſtice; crueltie, by the name of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie; night, by the name of light; evill, by the name of good, and the devill by the name of an Angell? Is not this to praiſe that which is to be deſpiſed and deteſted, to follow that which is to be fled, to love that which is to be hated, to bring into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the diſtinction of good and of evill, and to overthrow the order which God and nature have eſtabliſhed in the diſtinction of good and evill things.

The emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> would needs ſomething mitigate this proverbe, not allowing to make himſelfe feared, and yet diſdained not hatred: For he was wont to ſay, as by the way of a proverbe or device: <hi>Oderint dum probent,</hi> that is, Let them hate, ſo they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. But it ſeemes he made an evill match in coupling hatred with approbation: for

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that which a man hateth, hee dooth not willingly allow; and that which a man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, hee hateth not alſo. Moreover, all ſuch ſayings and proverbes (Let them hate, ſo they feare, and Let them hate, ſo they allow) are but tyrants devices, and our forefathers have ſo eſteemed them, and tyrants have alwayes practiſed them. As <hi>Nero,</hi> when he perceived that by his cruelties he was feared and redoubted, he brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that none of them which had been emperours before him, had any underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding how to command, neither knew they the power they had, to make themſelves be obeyed: But that power was well made knowne to himſelfe, for men made him well to feele<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That power evill exerciſed, acquireth hatred to him that exerciſeth it, and hatred, ruine and deſtruction: So happened it to <hi>Caligula,</hi> ſo to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and

                  <p>As for that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſayth, That the prince is feared as he will, and as it pleaſeth him: If this were true, all ſhould goe well for him: for hee would alwayes be ſo feared, as none ſhould oppoſe themſelves againſt his deſſeignes and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, but that every one ſhould come under the yoke, and obey him purely and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21818:117"/>
ſimply: But experience ſhewes us the contrarie, and makes us ſee and know, That a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> prince cannot long be obeyed, if that which he commandeth bee diſagreeable and found unjuſt of him that ſhould obey: inſomuch, as at the firſt occaſion that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth it ſelfe, they unyoke themſelves, and their obedience endureth no longer than force and neceſſitie endureth: And becauſe no force nor neceſſitie can actually endure long time: (becauſe no violent thing naturally laſteth) therefore it followeth, that diſagreeable commandements cannot long be obſerved; and that obedience, founded upon feare, is incontinent broken: For the equitie &amp; juſtice of a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is the ſinew thereof: And as the bodie cannot move without ſinewes, unles only for a leape like a ſtone; ſo a commaundement, which for want of equitie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth <note place="margin">Equitie is the ſinew of the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>And as for that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, That it is very hard for a prince to bee feared and loved together, it is cleane contrarie: For there is nothing more eaſie for <note place="margin">A prince may well be ſeated and loved toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> a prince, than to obtaine them both, as reaſon ſheweth it: Becauſe it is certaine, that a prince which maintaines his ſubjects in good peace, keepeth them from oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cauſing all them to bee puniſhed, which would oppreſſe them, and which will maintaine their liberties, and puniſh the breakers of them, and who will obſerve a good pollicie in his countrey, that therein there may be a free &amp; aſſured commerce, without impoſition of tributes or burdens, and he that ſhall cauſe good juſtice to be miniſtred to every one, it is certaine, that ſuch a prince ſhall be greatly beloved of his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſubjects, yea, and feared thus: When men underſtand, that the prince miniſtreth good juſtice in every place, without ſupport, favour, or corruption, leaving not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable faults unpuniſhed, and is not prodigall in graunting favours and pardons, unleſſe they have a good foundation upon reaſon and equitie, certaine it is, that hee ſhall be redoubted and feared, not only in his own countrey, but in ſtrange countries alſo. For example hereof, are all the ancient and good emperours, as <hi>Augustus, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, Adrian, Antonine,</hi> and others, which were together feared, beloved, and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. I could here alleadge almoſt all our aunceſtor kings of France, which with good juſtice, were not onely redoubted of their ſubjects, but alſo of all their neighbours: yea, that good reputation of juſtice in them, was a cauſe, that often ſtrange princes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have ſubmitted their contentions to the judgment of the Court of Paris in France, as we reade in hiſtories: And becauſe they cauſed to be miniſtred good juſtice, think you they were the more hated? no, not of the wickeder ſort, which are forced by their conſciences to love and admire the good and vertue, although their lives bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: And how ſhould they not be beloved of their ſubjects, beeing good kings as they were, ſeeing Frenchmen are of that nature, that they can never hate their king, how vicious ſoever he be, but alwaies impute vices and faults to ſome of his gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Counſellors, rather than to him? Truly, if princes had alwaies good men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, they could never bee vicious, at the leaſt to the detriment of the Commonwealth: Therefore by good right, men do impute the evill

I leave you a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome firme and aſſured, if you be good; but feeble and weake if you be wicked: for by concord ſmall things encreaſe, but by diſcord great things fall to ruine.</q> Behold a breefe exhortation, but very weightie, to ſhew how neceſſarie it is to have good

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> friends, and to maintaine good amity and loyaltie amongeſt parents. Like unto this is the oration which <hi>Silla</hi> made to king <hi>Boccus</hi> of Mauritania: <q>Wee are very joyfull (ſaid hee) that thou rather ſeekeſt to bee a friend, than an enemie of the Romane people: for, even from her birth, the Romane people being poore, have alwaies bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loved to acquire friends than ſlaves &amp; ſervants, &amp; have ever thought it more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to command voluntary people, than any by conſtraint: King <hi>Boccus</hi> then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe a better amity than ours, which can both favour thee, &amp; aide thee, &amp; will never hurt thee; &amp; to ſay truth, neither we, nor any other can have too many friends.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The amitie and friends which a prince may obtaine by a good and juſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may ſerve ſo to aſſure him of every man in his eſtate, that hee ſhall have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> neede of no guard, if hee thinke good to bee rid of them, as did that good empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Traian,</hi> who often went to viſit &amp; ſee his friends, onely accompanied with foure <note place="margin">Dion in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian.</note> or five gentlemen, without any guard of ſouldiers.

                  <p>Amitie (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is the true bonde of all humane ſocietie; and whoſoever will take amitie from amongſt men, as <hi>Machiavell</hi> doth from amongſt princes, he ſeekes to take away all pleaſure, ſolace, contentment and aſſurance that can bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt humane creatures: For the friend is another our ſelfe, with whom wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in our proſperitie, and our joy encreaſeth, when wee have unto whom to communicate it: for wee are alſo comforted with him in our adverſitie and ſorrowes, and our ſadneſſe is more than halfe diminiſhed, when wee have upon whom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, by amiable communication, the bitterneſſe of our heart. Moreover although wee bee ſometimes blind in our owne cauſes, yet our friend marketh our faults, and kindly ſheweth them unto us, and giveth us good counſell in our affaires, which we cannot take of our ſelves: Briefely, humane life without amitie, ſeemes no other thing then a ſad widowage, deſtitute of the chiefe ſweetneſſe and comfort, that can bee gathered in humane ſocietie, as <hi>Cicero, Plutarch,</hi> and other great philoſophers, have learnedly diſcourſed, unto which I ſend them, which will more amply under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which accompanie it: For, amongſt corne, commonly growes darnell, and amongſt wholeſome hearbs, ſome are venemous, which in outward ſhew ſeeme to bee faire and good; yet men may not caſt away a thing ſo neceſſarie as corne, for the feare to finde darnell or drauke in it, nor the wholeſome hearbs, for ſuch as bee venemous: But wee muſt ſeeke as much as may bee, to know, and to ſeparate that which is evill, from that which is good. And heere, that manner of electing friends, which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar</hi> obſerved, is worthie obſervation: for hee did not eaſily retaine every man in his friendſhip and familiaritie, but ever tooke time to proove and finde their <note place="margin">

Well I am content to agree unto them this morall ſence; and that their maſter

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> meant here to declare ſome ſingular &amp; memorable doctrine: Let us now come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it: He ſaith then, when a prince cannot fight like a man, that is by reaſon; he ought to fight like a beaſt, that is, to uſe force and ſubtiltie. To this I anſwere, that a prince in his quarrell hath either reaſon or right on his ſide, or els hee hath them not: If hee hath them not, he ought not to fight againſt any man: for each war ought to have his foundation upon reaſon, as other where wee have ſhewed: If the prince
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21818:121"/>
hath reaſon on his ſide, and he with whom hee hath to doe, refuſeth to come to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> then the prince may juſtly conſtraine him by force of armes: and this is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to fight like a beaſt, nor like a Lion, but it is to fight as a man uſing reaſon, who employeth his owne corporall force, and the force of his horſes, of his armies and walls, and of all other things offenſive and defenſive, to ſerve for inſtruments and meanes to execute that which reaſon commandeth and ordaineth: ſo that force em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <note place="margin">Force is a ſervant of reaſon.</note> to his right uſe, is no other thing but a ſervant of reaſon, which obeyeth her in all her commandements: and therefore therein there is nothing of a beaſt, and they which thus employ their forces, doe nothing that holds of a beaſt. As for guile and ſubtiltie, I ſay likewiſe, that in warre a man may lawfully uſe ſubtilties againſt his enemies, if ſo be his faith and the rights of warre bee not violated, and this is not

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> called foxlike ſubtiltie, or unlawful deceiving, but it ought to be called militarie pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: And therefore in warre to uſe ſubtiltie, fraud, and militarie ſharpeneſſe of wit (for all thoſe names may be well uſed) is not to counterfeit the beaſt, nor to play the Fox. But I know well, <hi>Machiavell</hi> is of another mind, namely, That a prince is not bound unto right, faith, or religious promiſe, to hinder him that he may not uſe now force, and now ſubtiltie, according as the one or the other may beſt ſerve him, to come to the end hee pretendeth: For of faith and promiſe, or of right and reaſon, men may not ſpeake in <hi>Machiavels</hi> ſchoole, unleſſe it be to mocke at them, which eſteeme ſuch, moſt holy bands of humane ſocietie: but concerning faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, we ſhall have another Maxime, wherein we ſhall rip up this matter to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that violence vvhich deſtroyeth all, is greatly to be reprehended, but ſo is not that vvhich tendeth to make things in better ſtate: Therefore is <hi>Romulus</hi> vvorthie of praiſe, that he himſelfe ſlevv his brother, &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſley <hi>Tatius</hi> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion, that hee alone might eſtabliſh a good policie at Rome, as after he did, erecting there a Senate, by vvhich hee

The example alledged of <hi>Oliver de Ferme,</hi> doth well ſhew it: for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued not long, no more than did <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> who by the like meanes had uſurped
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21818:126"/>
the domination of Romania, as hath beene before ſaid. But can a man imagine a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> more cruell and deteſtable act, than that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> rehearſeth of <hi>Oliver de Ferme?</hi> who (under the pretext of amitie) maſſacred moſt wickedly his owne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ſuch as had given him ſo honourable an entertainment as was poſſible? Yet <hi>Machiavell</hi> propoſeth this gallant example, for a prince to imitate, as hee had before done, with the example of <hi>Caeſar Borgia:</hi> And as for <hi>Agathocles,</hi> true it is (as <hi>Suidas</hi> and others write) hee uſurped the tyrannie of Sicile, by cauſing with treaſon and treacherie the chiefe rulers of <hi>Siracuſe</hi> to bee ſlaine: but what end made hee alſo? even ſuch as hee merited: For, being deſirous to make great his domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over Italie; hee thought beſt to practiſe with intelligencers, which kept not their word with him, inſomuch as his purpoſe being broken and anihilated, by the ſame meanes of treaſon and unfaithfulneſſe, by which hee made himſelfe great, hee died

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> with griefe and heavineſſe of minde. And ſtill are not theſe the judgements of God, who ruinates tyrants by the ſame waies, which hee ſuffers them to get up and come to advancement? And although <hi>Agathocles</hi> had ſo bad an end, as his life alſo had beene very wicked, yet dare <hi>Machiavell</hi> compare him with the greateſt and moſt vertuous captaines, that have in times paſt beene, and to offer him as an example, for a prince to imitate: So that men may well ſay, that this wicked Atheiſt, hath no other purpoſe in his bookes, than to perſuade a prince to become a tirant and moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, by embraſing all vices, and chaſing away all vertue: but heeretofore I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſcourſed upon the effects of crueltie, and therefore neede ſpeake no more heereof.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is not this a wiſe reaſon, to ſay, That crueltie ought to be exerciſed all at once, that it may not bee too often felt, as that is which is practiſed by little and little at many times: And why? that which is practiſed all at once is not felt, but at the inſtant it is practiſed: Nay contrarie wee commonly ſee, that ſuch great cruelties as men commit againſt a great number of perſons, doe ſo wound and irritate the hearts of all the kinſefolke and friends of them that bee murdered, that they feele it during their lives, yea ſometimes the wound bleedeth even to the third generation: But the cruelties which are committed at many and divers times, doe not ſo farre pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the courage, nor pricke men ſo lively to the quicke, although continuance encreaſeth diſcontentment. No man alſo can deny, but that it is a thing far more

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> fearefull and horrible to our ſenſes, to ſee a great ſlaughter, and a great heape of murdered perſons, than to ſee one onely or two: And no man can promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that that prince will handle him kindlie, who practſeth ſuch a generall maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre and ſlaughter, as <hi>Machiavell</hi> counſelleth, whatſoever good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance hee after ſheweth of his gentle and kinde carriage: For the firſt apprehenſion of his crueltie, will bee found ſo faſt ſticking and engraven in the hearts of men, that no demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of gentleneſſe and humilitie ſucceding, can aboliſh or raſe it out.

and wicked counſell, as we ſee bodies ulcerated with rods and cudgels. What

Alſo when one day a certaine philoſopher told him, that he could not be but happie, who was ſo rich, ſo well ſerved at his table, and had ſo goodly a pallace to dwell in, and ſo richly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: he anſwered him: Well, I will ſhew thee how happie I am: and withall hee led that philoſopher into a chamber gallantly hanged with tapiſtrie, and cauſed him to be laid on a guilded rich bed to repoſe himſelfe; there were alſo brought him exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit and delicate viands, and excellent wines: but whileſt certaine ſervants made theſe proviſions for <hi>Monſieur</hi> the philoſopher, who was ſo deſirous of a tyrannicall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, another varlet faſtened by the hilts to the upper bed feeling, a bright ſhining ſharpe ſword, and this ſword was hung only in a horſe haire, the point of it right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

And indeed it is one of the greateſt wiſdomes that can be in a tyrant, to take a good courſe for his death, when it is neceſſarie and expedient for him: for they are often troubled, &amp; doe come ſhort therein: as we ſee of <hi>Nero,</hi> who in his need could find no man that would ſley

If this ſecretarie had been one of <hi>Machiavels</hi> ſchollers, it is likely he would have prooved more hardie.</p>
                  <p>But we have to note, as well upon this Maxime, as upon the former, that as by his precepts here, <hi>Machiavell</hi> tendeth and goeth about to forme a tyrant, that alſo we ought to hold for a true tyrant, every prince and ruler, which uſeth theſe precepts, <note place="margin">Markes of tyrants.</note> and practiſeth them: that is, hee which uſeth the cruelties before commended by <hi>Machiavell,</hi> which maintaineth his ſubjects in diviſion and partialitie, and which

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> when of a king he became a tyrant: and theſe are ordinarily the colours and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie of all tyrants banners, whereby they may be knowne. It ſeemeth that <hi>Tarquin</hi> forgot nothing of all that a tyrant could doe, but that he ſlew not <hi>Brutus,</hi> which was a fault in the art of tyrannie (as learnedly <hi>Machiavell</hi> noteth it) which fell to bee his ruin: But the cauſe hereof was, that <hi>Brutus</hi> in the court counterfeted the foole, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Tarquin</hi> had no ſuſpition of him: For none but wiſe men and good people are ſuſpect and greevous to tyrants, but as for counterfeting fooles, unthrifts, flatterers, bauds, murderers, inventors of impoſts, and ſuch like dregs and vermine of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are beſt welcome into tyrants courts: yet even amongſt them are not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants alwaies without danger: for amongſt ſuch fooles ſometimes happeneth a <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>

                  <p>But the example of <hi>Hieronimus</hi> (another tyrant of Sicilie) is to this purpoſe well to be noted. This <hi>Hieronimus</hi> was the ſonne of a good and wiſe king, called <hi>Hiero,</hi> (whom alſo they well called tyrant, becauſe he came not to that eſtate by a legitimate title, although he exerciſed it ſincerely and in good juſtice) who when he died, left this <hi>Hieronimus</hi> his ſonne very young and under age: For the government therefore of him and of his affaires, he gave him fifteene tutors, and amongſt them <hi>Androno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> and <hi>Zoilus,</hi> his ſonnes in law, and one <hi>Thraſo,</hi> which he charged to maintaine the countrey of Sicilie in peace, as he himſelfe had done by the ſpace of fiftie yeares

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of his raigne: but eſpecially that they ſhould maintaine the treatie and confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he had all the length of his time, duly obſerved with the Romanes. The ſaid tutors promiſed to performe his requeſt, and to change nothing in the eſtate, but altogether to follow his footſteps. Straight after <hi>Hiero</hi> was dead, <hi>Andronodorus</hi> being angry becauſe of ſo many tutors, cauſed the king (who was then but 15 yeares old) to be proclaimed of ſufficient age to bee diſmiſſed of tutors, and ſo diſpatched himſelfe as well as others, of that dutifull care they ought to have had of their king and countrey: After, he got to himſelfe alone the government of the kingdome, and to make himſelfe to bee feared under the kings authoritie, hee tooke to him a great number of waiters for his guard, and to weare purple garments and a diademe upon

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> his head, and to goe in a coach drawne with white horſes, altogether after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Denis</hi> the tyrant, and contrary to the uſe of <hi>Hieronimus:</hi> yet was not this the worſt; for, beſides all this, <hi>Adronodorus</hi> cauſed the yong king his brother in law, to bee inſtructed in pride, and arrogancie, to contemne every man, to give audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to no man, to bee quarelous, and to take advantage at words; of hard acceſſe, given to all new faſhions of effeminacie and riotouſneſſe, and to bee unmeaſurable
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21818:128"/>
cruell, &amp; thirſtie after bloud. After <hi>Andronodorus</hi> had thus framed to his minde this

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> yong king, a conſpiration was made againſt him (unto which <hi>Andronodorus</hi> was conſenting) to diſpatch and ſley him, but it was diſcovered, but yet executed, which <note place="margin">A conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, yet executed.</note> was ſtrange: For one <hi>Theodorus</hi> was accuſed, and confeſſed himſelfe to bee one of the conſpiracie: but being tortured and racked to confeſſe his complices and parte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in that conſpiracie, knowing he muſt needs die, and by that meanes deſiring to be revenged of that yong tyrant, he accuſed the moſt faithfull and truſtieſt ſervants of the king: This young tyrant raſh &amp; inconſiderat, ſtraight put to death his friends and principal ſervants by the counſell of <hi>Andronodorus,</hi> who deſired nothing more, becauſe they hindered his deſeignes: This execution performed, incontinent this yong tyrant was maſſacred and ſlain upon a ſtraight way by the conſpirators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which before had made the conjuration, the execution whereof was the more eaſie, by the diſcoverie thereof, becauſe (as is ſaid) the tyrants moſt faithfull friends and ſervants were ſlaine. Soone after the tyrants death, <hi>Andronodorus</hi> obtained the fortreſſe of Siracuſe, a towne of Sicilie: but the tumults and ſtirres which he raiſed in the countrey (as he thought for his owne profit) fell out ſo contrarie to his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, that finally he, his wife, and all their race, and the race of <hi>Hieronimus</hi> were extermined, as well ſuch as were innocent, as they that were culpable. And ſo doth it ordinarily happen to all young princes, which by corruption are degenerated into tyrants: So fals it out alſo to all them, which are corrupters of princes, to draw them into habits of all wickedneſſe.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21818:129"/>
that law, the law of Oſtraciſme: and their reaſon was, becauſe people of high vertue

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> were ſomething ſuſpected, that they would ſeize upon all the domination of the commonwealth, if they ſhould be alwayes ſuffered to encreaſe: And it may be this reaſon was not altogether impertinent in the popular eſtate of the commonwealth of Athens, where there was ſome likelyhood, that a great man endowed with great vertues, might by little and little ſteale away the peoples hearts and favour, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to take to himſelfe the ſole domination and authoritie of the commonweale: and notwithſtanding they had this law at Athens, which they often practiſed againſt the greateſt and moſt vertuous perſons, as againſt <hi>Pericles, Themiſtocles, Alcibiades,</hi> and other ſuch like great and good men: yet this was not becauſe they hated their great vertues; but contrarie they greatly admired them, yet were they ſuſpected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

And men muſt not thinke, that when they bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed men by their Oſtraciſme, that therein they imputed unto them any villanie or diſhonour, but rather this kind of baniſhment was honorable, and they which were baniſhed, were eſteemed men of great &amp; excellent vertue: True it is, they could have been content to have eſcaped that honour, as alſo many perſons of baſe vertue, which would have been glad to have been ſo baniſhed by an Oſtraciſme, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to one <hi>Hiperbolus,</hi> a man of ſmall vertue, whom yet the Athenians ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to baniſh him by an Oſtraciſme, but they never ſhewed the like favour to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his qualitie: Neither was this, becauſe <hi>Hiperbolus</hi> had committed any fault,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which merited, that they ſhould ſo baniſh him; but becauſe it ſo fell out at the end of ten yeares (at which time they muſt needs put in practiſe that law:) The Athenians having then, neceſſarie uſe of their good and greateſt men, knew not upon whom better to practiſe it, than upon this bad companion, who with his audaciouſneſſe and popular ſermons, had gathered together great riches: <hi>Hiperbolus</hi> then (having no long time made himſelfe knowne to the Athenian people by his orations) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this honour and recompence, to bee baniſhed by the Oſtraciſme, the greateſt honour that ever he had in his life.

                  <p>But in a prince this ought to have no place; for the more vertuous that men bee, <note place="margin">Excellent vertues ought not to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of a prince.</note> the more they ought to love and honour them, and to ſerve themſelves with them: for in ſo doing, the vertues of ſuch good and vertuous ſervants are imputed unto the prince himſelfe, as we have before ſhewed; neither can a prince ever draw any great ſervices from men of ſmall vertue: for good ſervices are the effects of vertue: And as no man out of a buſh or bramble, can get good peares or other pleaſant fruits, becauſe ſuch kind of plants have not that kind of vertue in them to produce

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſuch kind of fruits; in like ſort, a prince cannot looke for gallant and good ſervices from vicious men of baſe vertue: A prince alſo can have no juſt occaſion to hold for ſuſpected, men of great vertue, for many reaſons: firſt, becauſe ſuch perſons have in greater recommendation the integritie of their fame and honour, than men have which are of meane fortune, or (as they ſay) of a baſe hand, and therefore will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily attempt any filthie or wicked thing, which may turne to their diſhonor. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe ſeeing themſelves beloved, honoured, and recompenced for their good ſervices by their prince, their love and deſire well to ſerve him, will more and more encreaſe, and ſo prove a meanes directly contrary to all evill enterpriſes. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men of excellent vertue are alwaies of generous and great courages &amp; minds:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but it is a thing altogether repugnant to all generoſitie, to commit wicked enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt a good prince: yea, and a worke of faint-hearted villaines. Finally, in the time wherein wee are (principalities and kingdomes being beſtowed either by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditarie ſucceſſion, or by the election of certaine nobles, and not by an election tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuarie and violent of corrupted perſons) they ſhould be very madde, to aſpire to his place, or to enterpriſe any evill againſt him, to deprive themſelves of that good they alreadie enjoy, without all likelyhood to attaine unto better: And if with al this, a vertuous man have any feare of God, he will enterpriſe no evill againſt his prince, even for this only cauſe, that God willeth and commandeth, that we obey our prince and that we honour him above all things in the world: ſo that he which diſobeyeth

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and perjurie: But as for trompery, which men call ſubtiltie, wee have of it above ſufficientlie ſpoken: And as for perfidie and perjurie, wee ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpeake in another Maxime, and therefore heereupon wee will make no long diſcourſe, becauſe wee will not often repeate one ſame thing: And withall that there is no man in the world, of ſo ſmall a judgement, who doth not well ſee that this Maxime containeth a deteſtable doctrine, altogether unworthie not onely of a prince, but of every man, of what condition ſo ever hee bee: And I doe not beleeve that the Bohemians, who goe from countrey to countrey, telling good fortunes, juglers, or rather runnagate roagues, which make an occupation of deceits and abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing of the world, will not condemne this Maxime, as wicked and abhominable, if

                  <p>And as for that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, That the deceiver will alwayes find ſome that will ſuffer themſelves to bee deceived, I confeſſe there will bee ever found ſome idiot fooles and ſots, that he may deceive, yea that ſometimes he may deceive ſharp witted and wiſe men: yet notwithſtanding, it is as certaine, that there is not ſo great a deceiver, but he is ſometimes deceived: For as ſoone as a deceiver is diſcovered to

Therefore <hi>Machiavell</hi> his reaſon, That the deceiver ſhall alwayes find them which will be deceived, doth not ſo well conclude, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: For if the deceiver find alwaies ſome to deceive, he ſhall alſo find ſome which will deceive him: and it may be ſometimes, for one that he deceiveth, hee may find ſixe which will deceive him: becauſe none can bee ſo perfect in the art of trompery

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> (which art <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſo much recommendeth to a prince) but alſo hee ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies finde others, which know more than himſelfe in ſome points, and many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe know more than one alone, in all points of that art, one in one point, and another in another: So that in the end hee himſelfe ſhall ſee alwaies (according to the common proverbe) the deceiver ſhall bee deceived.</p>
                  <p>As it happened even to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, whoſe example <hi>Machiavell</hi> heere alledgeth; for the end of all his tromperies and perjuries, was to make his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> lord &amp; king of all Italie, and after, of all chriſtendome if he could: But the iſſue of his deſſeignes and purpoſes was a tragicall act, as wee have before diſcourſed in another place. Moreover, the cauſe why that many times this Pope

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> deceived chriſtian princes, and even the king of France <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, was: For that in that time men ſo greatlie feared the Popes bulls and interdictions, and that they beleeved him to bee a true lieutenant of God, on earth, ſo that they durſt not diſcredit any thing hee did, but rather beleeved all his wordes as oracles: but at this day children would mocke at his actions, and few men will bee baited with his allurements.</p>
                  <p>But for whereas <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, That the ancient Romanes under the deceit of <note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were not ſlaves.</note> thoſe names, Allies and confederats, brought into their ſubjection and ſervitude the Latin people their neighbours, is a plaine and pure lie: For they ſubjugated all men by warre, at divers times as wee reade in hyſtories. True it is, that after once they van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and brought them under, they then made treaties of peace and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which were not greatly to the advantage of ſuch as were overcome, as in reaſon they might: For if by the right of nations, ſuch as are vanquiſhed by warres, may be bondſlaves of the vanquiſhers: by a ſtronger reaſon may the vanquiſhers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to themſelves ſome preheminence, over the vanquiſhed: But the preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which commonly the Romanes reſerved to themſelves, in all their treaties, were that the allies and confederats, ſhould not make warre upon any without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that they ſhould contribute unto their ſouldiers in their warres: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they left to all people, their franchiſes, liberties, goods, religion, magiſtrates, and all other things, without altering any thing, and without impoſing upon them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of mony or ſuch like. This cannot bee called a ſervitude, as <hi>Machiavell</hi> calls it; or if it bee a ſervitude, there are no people in chriſtendome, whether they be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of princes, or common wealthes, which are not in a double, and quadruple ſervitude.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, That a prince ought to know the art of trompery, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> I anſwere for <hi>Machiavell,</hi> that no man can give precepts, practicale or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular which may bee applied to every buſines, to avoide deceit and fraude: But the generall precepts of art (which the philoſophers call Axiomes in philoſophie) are theſe; Bouldly to forſweare themſelves; Subtilly to diſſemble, to infinuate into mens minds and to prove them; To breake faith and promiſe, and ſuch like as heeretofore wee have handled, and ſhall doe heereafter: But heere we muſt note one thing, which is, That one well experienced in the art of trompery, will not alwaies practiſe that principle, To breake faith, for if he ordinarilie doe it, hee ſhall offend againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other principle, which commands, To diſſemble ſubtilly: For by, every where and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver breaking of faith, hee ſhall diſcover himſelfe to bee a manifeſt deceiver, whereas

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hee ought to diſſemble, and to make an outward countenance not to bee ſo, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee a good and an honeſt man: And therefore to obſerve all the principles, of that art together, without breaking one in obſerving another, hee ſhall in ſmall matters keepe his faith, to breake it in great things, and in matters of conſequence. Heereof <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> admoniſheth <hi>Scipio</hi> to take heede: <q>Thou deſireſt <hi>Scipio</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and contentment, as it moves them to thanke their prince for that good, and to praiſe and bleſſe him, yea, to pray unto God for his conſervation and proſperitie. In all the peace that was made in Fraunce ſince the civile warres, there hath alwayes been ſeene an experience thereof: For a man may well ſay, that the king accorded peace to the Proteſtants as it were by conſtraint, which indeede is contained in the edicts of peace: for the king himſelfe ſo declared it in other edicts which hee made when the warre was renued; as he declared by an edict in the yeare 1568, wherein hee ſaith, That hee had alwayes had in his heart to aboliſh the religion of the ſaid Proteſtants, and the cauſe of his before ſuffering it, had been as by conſtraint, and to accommodate himſelfe to the time. The Courtiers alſo have alwayes called it the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Suffered Religion, and the Catholicke Romane, the authoriſed Religion: Although then that thoſe goodly edicts of peace were accorded by the king againſt his heart, yet ceaſed not the people to be thankfull unto the king, yea, to praiſe and exalt him as a lover of the good, and repoſe of his poore people, and to bleſſe and praiſe God for him both publickely and privately. But put the caſe, that were true which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavell</hi> ſaith, That the ſubjects of a prince cannot be thankfull for a benefit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by conſtraint, it followeth not therefore, that ſuch a benefit and a better hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling muſt needs be unprofitable and without fruit: For certaine it is, that alwaies this will make ceaſe the complaints of the people, and cauſe them to deſiſt from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions and whatſoever enterpriſes are intended &amp; machinated againſt him. <hi>Titus</hi>

There hath beene many times ſeene in Fraunce, rebellions and ſtirres of the people for new impoſts, which ſtraight were ſtayed, by taking them away: And indeed naturall reaſon ſheweth well, that it ought ſo to be: For in all things, of what ſort ſoever they bee, as ſoone as the cauſe is taken away, men alſo take away the effect thereof: Moreover, I will not denie but this is of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> very evill conſequence, that a profit ſhould come of a rebellion and ſedition: but upon this point it is worth noting, that ſeldome or never people ariſe without ſome great, juſt, and urgent occaſion: &amp; therefore if the prince have not done his dutie to cut off that occaſion before, but that thereby there ariſe rebellion &amp; ſedition, he may not find it ſtrange nor evill, to remedie it, rather late than never, and ſo to purge his negligence. A prince in ſtead to harden his heart againſt his ſubjects (as <hi>Machiavell</hi> teacheth) ſhall doe better, not to bee ſo obſtinate, but to plie and bow his courage, when the good of the commonweale and his owne requireth it? following the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition which that wiſe knight <hi>Phenix</hi> gave to the prince <hi>Achilles</hi> his diſciple.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that ſouldiers muſt needs be paid: For (ſaid they) if the commonwealth ſtand not by Faith, it cannot ſtand by riches: It were therefore better to ſpend the good of the commonwealth in loyally paying ſouldiers wages, and ſo acquite themſelves of their Faith towards them, than to ſpare the commonwealth by the failing of Faith and word.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> for thou knoweſt, that in the ſhew of friendſhip, and under the ſhaddow of a feaſt in thy houſe, thou diddeſt invite my dead father, and being come, thou retainedſt him and brought him moſt villanouſly to his death: therefore by thine owne confeſſion thou doeſt merit a moſt ignominious death.</q> Straight after, the king commaunded that he ſhould be hanged and ſtrangled, which was done: So this perfidious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall <hi>Heber</hi> received the reward of his perfidie and breach of Faith, as hee himſelfe judged to have merited.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> loſt a battaile at Eſturmelin againſt the Scots, all England imputed the evill lucke of that loſſe unto the evill government of the <hi>Spenſers.</hi> They beleeving that the great lords of England, which envied their credit, had cauſed this brute to bee ſowne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take vengeance thereof, by a moſt perfidious &amp; diſloiall meanes: For they perſuaded the king to convocate a generall aſſemblie of States, to adviſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide (as they gave to underſtand) for the affaires of the kingdome: The princes and lords of the kingdome not doubting any thing, aſſembled at the kings commaund: But incontinent as they were aſſembled, king <hi>Edward</hi> (whome the <hi>Spenſers</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that his princes and lords meant to get his kingdome from him) comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to be taken, &amp; arreſted priſoners: which was done; and without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of cauſe, he cut off the heads from two and twentie of the greateſt lords and princes of the kingdome: and amongſt them there was beheaded <hi>Thomas</hi> duke of Lancaſter, the kings uncle, who was a good and a ſage prince, and who after was cannonized and ſaincted. This perfidie joyned with crueltie (for commonly the one goeth with the other) was the cauſe that the ſaid king was deprived by all the States of England, of his royaltie, as unworthie to carrie the crowne, and was confined to priſon, where he finiſhed his daies: And the <hi>Spenſers,</hi> authors of ſuch diſloialtie, were executed and rigorouſly puniſhed, according to their merits: For after they had ben drawne on hurdles through the ſtreets all over the citie of Herford; their privie parts were firſt cut away and caſt into the fire; then were their hearts taken out of their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſeventh, who making his proceſſe at Paris, his head was cut off in the place <hi>de</hi> Greve. True it is, that the ſaid countie had committed great faults, as well againſt the king, as againſt the duke: hee had alſo alwaies ſtudied to nouriſh warre betwixt the ſaid two princes; yet notwithſtanding it was a very diſhonorable and infamous thing, for the duke to take him priſoner, after hee had given him his faith and aſſurance, by the ſafe conduct which hee graunted him: For if hee had not beene, hee had (according to his determination) with his ſilver, fled into Almaigne, &amp; from thence in time he might have made his peace, and againe have come into the kings favour: But he was deceived as before: and the ſaid perfidie was ſo much the more infamous and diſhoneſt, becauſe it was perpetrated by this duke of Bourgoigne, for the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to gaine the townes of S. Quinten, Han and Bohain, which belonged to the ſaid countie, which the king gave to the ſaid duke, to the end, hee would deliver and betray him. But behold the juſt judgement of God, who permitted, that this duke of Bourgoigne was in the end beaten with the ſame rods wherewith hee had beaten the countie of S. Pol: for being twice overthrowne at Granſon and Morat, by the Suiſſers, the ſiege of Nus, ſucceeding evill unto him, and alſo, having loſt the dutchie of Lorraine (which before he had unjuſtly occupied upon the duke of Lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raine, who conquered it) all theſe traverſes and troubles engendred ſuch greefe, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and confuſion in his ſpirit, and great indiſpoſition in his perſon, that hee was never after whole, either in bodie or mind: His wits thus comming into decay, there

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> came into his braine a diſtruſt of his owne ſubjects, and therefore thought good to ſerve himſelfe with ſtrangers, and to chuſe a loyall and faithfull nation, he addreſſed himſelfe to a countie <hi>de Campobache,</hi> an Italian, and gave him charge to bring with him many Italians to his ſervice, as hee did. This was the laſt act of the Tragedie of his life: For this countie <hi>de Campobache</hi> ceaſed not till he had betrayed him unto the duke of Lorraine before Nancy, which the ſaid duke of Bourgoigne held beſieged, and there was ſlaine in an aſſault, which the duke of Lorraine gave him, to conſtrain him to raiſe the ſiege. And ſo in like ſort, as by perfidie and violating of his faith, he had cauſed the conſtable of S.

                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:21818:141"/>
replied by goodly diſtinctions well truſſed together, whereby hee ſhewed, that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there are three kinds of confederations and treaties of peace: one, with ſuch as are vanquiſhed by warre, unto whom the vanquiſhers may give law: the ſecond kind, when two enemies, equall in forces, doe make peace without battaile; in which kind, as they are like in force, ſo ought the compacts and conditions of peace to be alike and egall: and the third is, when they which never were enemies before, are reduced to amitie and confederation, in which kind, neither of them ought to give law to the other: adding to this diſtinction, that the king their maſter was of this third kind, and that therefore they were abaſhed, that <hi>Quintius</hi> would give him a law, ſaying, That he muſt needs avoid Europe. <hi>Quintius,</hi> who was nothing expert in making di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, unleſſe it were with the ſword, although otherwiſe of good naturall ſence:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <q>Well (ſaid he) you have made me a diſtinction, and I will make you another: There are two kinds of warres; the one may be made in Aſia, the other may be made in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope: Touching the laſt kind, the Romans have juſt cauſe to enterpriſe wars againſt your maſter for the guard of the townes of Greece, leaſt they ſhould fall into the hands of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> according as they have preſerved them from the hands of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> king of Macedonie: and as for the firſt kind, the Romanes are content not to deale at all: and if king <hi>Antiochus</hi> your maſter will make warre in Aſia, let him doe it, we will not hinder him.</q> The ſaid embaſſadors (which accounted to have brought much to paſſe by their ſubtill diſtinction) were much aſtoniſhed, when they heard this contradiſtinction of <hi>Quintius:</hi> for they could not replie one word: And in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> end ther was no remedie but <hi>Antiochus</hi> muſt paſſe (by the diſtinction of <hi>Quintius)</hi> to avoid Europe. Hereby is ſeene, that ſuch ſubtilties and palliations in treaties of peace and obſervation of Faith, are but ridiculous things: For the affaires of the world ought to be governed by a common ſence and ſolid judgement, and not by ſubtilties of diſtinctions, which ſhould bee ſent unto Sophiſters and Logicians, to maintaine their arguments in ſchooles.</p>
                  <p>The Grecians have alwaies been great maſters in ſubtilties (as their writings <note place="margin">

                     </note> ſhew) yea, too much: for often it hath happened, that determining to governe the affaires of their commonweales, rather by ſubtill reaſons, than by arguments foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon good judgement, they have overthrowne themſelves into utter ruines and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> confuſions. Hereof there is a very memorable example in the Peloponeſiake warre deſcribed by <hi>Thucydides,</hi> which endured eight and twentie yeares, and well nigh ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated all Greece from top to toe, as wee ſay: for it was founded upon a ſubtiltie of ſmall importance. This was the matter: Two of the greateſt commonweales of all Greece were the commonweales of the Athenians &amp; of the Lacedaemonians, for all the reſt were ſmall in compariſon of them, and were in a conjunction by a aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either with the one or the other, except ſome few, as that of the Corcyrians, which neither aſſociated with the Athenians nor with the Lacedaemonians. Theſe two great commonweales had a treatie of confederacie together, wherein amongſt other articles there was one which ſaid, That if any of the cities of Greece, which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were not then leagued with either the one or the other of the commonweales, would aſſociate themſelves either to one or the other, they lawfully might. But ſo it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Corcyrians had warre againſt the Corinthians, which were aſſociated with the Lacedaemonians: inſomuch, as the Corcyrians feeling themſelves weake, practiſed to enter into league and ſocietie with the Athenians, ſhewing them, that they might receive them into their ſocietie: The Corinthians on the contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21818:142"/>
to the Athenians, That if they received the Corcyrians into their ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to aid them in this warre againſt them, it were to doe againſt the ſaid article, the which was to bee underſtood in the wholeſomeſt and beſt ſence, and not to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and ruine of the confederates: and that ſuch as would ſo interprete it, That it were lawfull for the Athenians to receive the Corcyrians into their ſocietie, for them to warre upon the Lacedaemonians, Corinthians, and other confederates, comprehended in the ſaid treatie, ſhould be an interpretation to an evill ſence, too eaſily making an overture to breake the ſaid treatie of peace, after the appetite of a third, which was no confederate: And that therefore the ſaid article muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie bee underſtood, in ſuch manner, as the reception of new aſſociates might bee without the domage and prejudice of ſuch as were comprehended in that confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Corcyrians replied, That although in the ſaid article be not expreſſed,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that it ſhould be lawfull to receive aſſociates, to make warre againſt confederates or others: yet muſt it be ſo underſtood, eſpecially, when new aſſociates make warre for a good right and juſt quarrell, as ours is (ſaid they) againſt the Corinthians: and that the treatie could not be violated, neither is the interpretation contrary to equitie, whenſoever men will maintaine right and reaſon. The Athenians made no account of the interpretation of the ſaid treatie which the Corinthians ſet before them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was conformable and agreeing to the ſence and equitie of that confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather held it better to ſticke unto the Corcyrians: On the other ſide, the Lacedaemonians banded themſelves for the Corinthians their aſſociates, as reaſon

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> required, and by that meanes thoſe two great commonweales were brought to the skirmiſh of warre one againſt another, by meanes of the Corcyrians and Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which ſet them together by the eares. After the Athenians and Lacedaemonians entred warres together, they drew after them all the reſt of Greece, or the moſt part into the ſame skirmiſh, ſome of the one part, ſome of the other: but this Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſiack warre was great, cruell, long, and ſuch as had almoſt utterly overthrowne the eſtate of Greece upſide downe: and all this came upon the captious interpretation (contrarie to all equitie and reaſon) which the Corcyrians made of the foreſaid arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the treatie of confederation.</p>
                  <p>In like manner was the ſubtill diſputation of ſuch as cauſed <hi>Pompeius,</hi> that famous

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                     <note place="margin">Plutarch. in Pomp.</note> captaine, to die. After <hi>Pompeius</hi> had loſt the battaile of Pharſalia againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he embarked on the ſea with his wife &amp; certain of his friends, hoovering about Aegypt, hoping there to be welcome, and entertained by the young king <hi>Ptolomaeus,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the pleaſures which hee had ſometimes done to his father. At his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching the land of Aegypt, he ſent a meſſenger in a boat to that young king, who was in the towne of Peluſium, to know if he would receive him in aſſurance: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the kings affaires were then managed by three baſe perſons, which underſtood nothing leſſe, than well to governe affaires of State, whereof the firſt was a meane chamberlaine of his; and the other two, <hi>Theodotus</hi> the Rhetorician his ſchoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and <hi>Achillas</hi> his domeſticall ſervant: Theſe three venerable perſons fel to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to deliberate what anſwere the king their maſter ſhould make to <hi>Pompeius:</hi> At the beginning they differed in opinion, one ſaying, that it were good to receive him, and the other, not: But in the end al three accorded in the worſt opinion they could have taken, which was, to receive <hi>Pompey,</hi> and to ſlay him: Which opinion, this goodly Rhetorician <hi>Theodotus</hi> perſuaded to the other two by his ſubtile reaſons. If we receive <hi>Pompeius</hi> (ſaith he) certaine it is, wee ſhall have <hi>Caeſar</hi> for an enemie, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:21818:142"/>
                     <hi>Pompeius</hi> for a maſter: If we receive him not, they will be both our enemies; <hi>Pompey</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for rejecting him, and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> becauſe we have not ſtayed him: But if we receive him, and put him to death, <hi>Caeſar</hi> will thanke us, and <hi>Pompeius</hi> cannot revenge himſelfe upon us, nor endammage us: for a dead man is no warrior. Vpon theſe goodly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that ſubtile rhetorician, the concluſion was taken by theſe three bad peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to put to death this great perſon <hi>Pompeius,</hi> who had had ſo many triumphs and victories in his life, &amp; who had ſeene to wait on him ſometimes five or ſix great kings at once, to entreat him as an arbitror of their contentions and differencies. If theſe bad Counſellors had conſidered the greatneſſe of <hi>Pompeius,</hi> who had ſo many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends, vertuous and great lords, as alſo the magnanimitie of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which would vanquiſh by true force, and not by perfidies and treaſons, they would never

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> have ſtaied upon the cold and fooliſh ſubtilties of this gentle Rhetorician, and they would not have concluded the death of ſo great a man: But yet they concluded it, and executed their concluſion, cauſing <hi>Pompey</hi> to die, as ſoone as he had taken port in Aegypt: But it was not long ere they received the reward of their perfidie, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that ſubtiltie: for <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſoone after arrived in Aegypt, unto whom <hi>Pothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Achillas</hi> preſented the head of <hi>Pompeius,</hi> thinking greatly to pleaſure him: <hi>Caeſar</hi> turned his face backward, becauſe he would not ſee him, and begun to weepe, and withall commanded to put <hi>Pothinus</hi> and <hi>Achillas</hi> to death, which had profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that preſent, which was preſently done: And that ſubtile reaſon of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who perſuaded them, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would thanke them for their murder, was not found

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> true. <hi>Theodotus</hi> ſeeing this execution, and finding himſelfe very culpable, fled, and yet lived certaine yeares, miſerably wandring and begging here and there, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (being known) to be maſſacred of the world, which every where had him in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration: But in the end, after the death of <hi>Caeſar, Brutus</hi> by chaunce light upon him, and cauſed him to die miſerably, after he had made him endure infinit torments. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the end of thoſe three Counſellors of that young king <hi>Ptolomaeus,</hi> who alſo by their evill conduction made but a poore end: for he was ſlaine in a battell nigh Nile, and none could ever find his bodie. Would to God ſuch as reſemble at this day theſe three Counſellors, might receive ſemblable guerdon and reward as they did, to learne them to conclude the committing of maſſacres and the uſe of perfidies

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and treaſons, which will not faile them in the end: for God is juſt.</p>
                  <p>But the skoffe which <hi>Theodotus</hi> alledged in the fore-mentioned counſell, That a dead man makes no warre, is at this day ordinarily in the mouthes of our Italianized courtiers, &amp; thereupon they ground their counſels, to ſley and maſſacre all ſuch as they hate: We muſt (ſay they) ſley this and that man, it is good to diſpatch them, for a dead man makes no warre: But if a man reply upon them, that a dead man yet may becauſe of warre, although he can make no warre: what would they anſwere?

This wiſe ſpeech of this young prince, touched ſo well the heart of <hi>Severus</hi> (although he was cruell) that hee would needs ceaſe from his ſlaughter, but that <hi>Plautianus</hi> and other courtiers, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the enriching of themſelves by confiſcations, incited him to continue.

No good princes or very few were at any time vanquiſhed or ſlaine, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of their eſtate, but only ſuch as well merited it, as <hi>Nero, Caligula, Otho, Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and other like, which were cruell and full of vices, and like <hi>Galba</hi> and <hi>Pertinax,</hi> which were exceedingly given to covetouſneſſe, than which vice, nothing becomes a prince worſe: But <hi>Augustus, Traian, Adrian,</hi> our father <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> and ſuch like, as they modeſtly governed, ſo deceaſed they honourably and without violence. <hi>Caſsius</hi> was a good and valiant captaine, whoſe fault wee deſired to have pardoned, becauſe it rather proceeded of temeritie than of evill will againſt us, beeing perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when he made his enterpriſe, that we had ben dead: and although he could never have excuſed himſelfe, but that he had greatly injured our children, which by right and reaſon ought to ſucceed us in our eſtate, yet would not wee have had him to die

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for that: for if our children merited to ſucceed us in the empite, <hi>Caſsius</hi> could not have overthrowne their eſtate: but if contrary, <hi>Caſsius</hi> had better deſerved than they to governe the comomwealth, and had been better beloved, it had alſo been reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and juſt hee had been emperour.</q> By this anſwere of that good emperour, a man may ſee how facile and eaſie he was to pardon offences againſt him, which is a very covenable vertue in a prince: for a prince can hardly rigorouſly puniſh faults committed againſt himſelfe, but he ſhall be taxed and blamed for rigour and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, although the fault merit greevous puniſhment, as the ſame emperour witneſſeth by his miſſive reſcribed unto the Senate, which made too rigorous a purſute againſt the complices of <hi>Caſsius:</hi> And becauſe the ſaid letters containe notable ſentences

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> worthie of ſuch a prince, I will here tranſlate them. <q>I pray (ſaith he) and require you (Maſters) that in regard of the Caſſian conſpiration, you will depoſe and lay aſide your cenſure, and conſerve my pietie and clemencie, yea, your own, and let none die that be culpable: let no Senator be puniſhed, nor noble blood bee ſhed: let ſuch as are baniſhed, be called againe, and let their conſiſcated goods be yeelded unto them againe, and would to God that I could revoke and call again to life ſuch as are dead:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:21818:146"/>
For there was never found, that a prince committed a good vengeance of his owne

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> greefe, but it was alwayes thought too rigorous and ſharpe, though never ſo juſt: I would have you then to pardon <hi>Caſsius</hi> his children, his ſonne in law, and his wife: How ſhould I not ſay pardon, ſince they have done nothing, let them live in all aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſo know that they live under the empire of <hi>Marcus:</hi> Let them enjoy their fathers patrimonie, his gold, his ſilver, and other their goods, that they may be rich, aſſured, free, and let them be examples of our pietie and clemencie, alſo of yours, in the mouth of al the world. Neither (ô ye Conſcript Fathers) is it any great clemencie to pardon the children and wives of ſuch as are baniſhed and condemned, ſince I demand and pray for pardon, even of the culpable themſelves, whether they be Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators or knights, that you may deliver them from death, from confiſcations, from

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> infamie, from feare, from envie, &amp; from all injuries, and that you will do this, whileſt we raigne, that they which were ſlaine in the tumult for enterpriſing againſt us, bee not defamed.</q> After this miſſive was read in the Senate houſe, all the Senators with an honorable acclamation begun to crie, The gods conſerve <hi>Antonine</hi> the clement, <hi>Antonine</hi> moſt pittifull, <hi>Antonine</hi> moſt mercifull: The gods perpetuate thy empire into thy race: We wiſh all good to thy Wiſedome, to thy Clemencie, to thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to thy Nobilitie, and to thy Innocencie. This acclamation declareth well how amiable &amp; acceptable Clemencie makes a prince: for there is nothing in the world that better gains the hearts of men, nor that brings to a prince more reverence and love, than this gentleneſſe and lenitie of heart: And indeed this good emperour by

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> his Clemencie got thus much, that after his death, all Rome made a certaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that he was aſcended into heaven, as to the place of his originall: Becauſe (ſaid they) it was impoſſible, that ſo good a ſoule, endowed with ſo excellent vertues, ſhold come from any other place than from heaven, either returne againe to any other place. The very name of <hi>Antonine</hi> was alſo ſo reverenced and loved of all the world from father to ſonne in many yeares and generations after him, that many empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours his ſucceſſors cauſed themſelves to bee called <hi>Antonines,</hi> that the rather they might be beloved of the people, though that name belonged not unto them, nor were of the race or familie of <hi>Marcus Antonine:</hi> as did <hi>Diadumenus</hi> the emperour <hi>Macrinus</hi> his ſonne and his companion in the empire, and as alſo did <hi>Baſsianus</hi> and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                     <hi>Geta, Severus</hi> his children, and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> they were all ſurnamed <hi>Antonines.</hi> But as this name appertained not unto them, ſo held they nothing of the vertues of that good emperour, with whoſe name they decked themſelves. Yet many reprehended in <hi>Marcus Antonine</hi> this his great Clemencie, whereby he ſo eaſily pardoned ſuch as had conſpired againſt him, ſaying, That he provided evill for the ſafetie of himſelf and his children, to ſuffer conſpirators to live: This was but a meanes to emboulden wicked people to enterpriſe conſpiracies: and amongſt others, the empreſſe <hi>Fauſtine</hi> his wife, found it evill and of bad conſequence, that he puniſhed not rigorouſly the partakers of <hi>Caſsius,</hi> whereupon he writ a very memorable letter to this effect. <q>Very religiouſly doſt thou (ô <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> my deare companion) to have care of the aſſurance

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of us and our children: but whereas thou admoniſheſt me to puniſh the complices of <hi>Avidius Caſsius,</hi> I do advertiſe thee, that I had rather pardon them: for nothing more recommendeth a Romane emperour amongſt all nations, than Clemencie. That was it which placed <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in the number of the gods; which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> which gave that moſt honourable title of <hi>Pius,</hi> that is, gentle and godly to thy father: Finally, <hi>Caſsius</hi> himſelfe had not beene ſlaine, if my advice
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:21818:146"/>
had been demanded in the ſlaying of him. I pray thee therefore my deare compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be not afraid, but hold thy ſelfe aſſured under the protection of the gods, who no doubt will guard us, becauſe pietie and Clemencie are ſo pleaſant and agreeable unto them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For a reſolution then, certaine it is, that nothing can ſo become, or is ſo worthy of a prince to practiſe, as Clemencie, by pardoning ſuch as offend him, and even them which have committed ſome fault, that may bee excuſed by ſome equitable reaſon, and by mitigating the puniſhments of the law to ſuch, as upon cuſtome commit no exceſſe, and which otherwiſe are vertuous and valorous people, and their offence not exceeding great and hainous: for if otherwiſe a prince uſe his Clemencie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having theſe conſiderations before his eyes, his fact will rather hold of crueltie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and injuſtice, than of clemencie: but for a man to practiſe it with a counterpoiſe and equall ballance of equitie, juſtice can be nothing interreſſed, but rather ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and applied to his true rule.</p>
                  <p>But aſſuredly, as a princes Clemencie bringeth to his ſubjects the fruit of a good equitie, ſo doth it alſo acquire unto himſelfe this ineſtimable good, to be beloved of every one, as was <hi>Marcus Antonine</hi> the emperour. The like happened to <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> upon him: Moreover, hee would never ſuffer, that any were puniſhed, who did not well deſerve it. Likewiſe his ſonne <hi>Titus</hi> was ſo good and clement, that hee was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver blamed for bearing evill will to any man, &amp; often he had this word in his mouth: <hi>That he had rather periſh himſelfe, than loſe any:</hi> He was of the people ſurnamed, <hi>The delights of mankind,</hi> for his kindneſſe and Clemencie. In like ſort <hi>Traian, Adrian, Pius, Tacitus,</hi> and many other Romane emperours were ſo beloved and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their ſubjects for their naturall humanitie and Clemencie, that they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after their deaths in the rowle of their gods.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whenſoever a prince ſhall be ſoft and clement, there is no doubt but <note place="margin">Clemencie cauſe of good works</note> his ſubjects will imitate him therein: for it is the peoples nature to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> unto their princes manners, as the Proverbe ſaith:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>The example of the princes life in all things commonly</l>
                     <l>The ſubiect ſeekes to imitate with all his poſsibilitie.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But whenſoever ſubjects doe imitate that moſt excellent vertue of Debonairetie and Clemencie, certaine alſo it is, that the whole bodie of the commonwealth is much better compoſed, more quiet, and better governed: For when men are given to that vertue, they will withall addict themſelves to Iuſtice, Temperance, Charitie, Pietie, and all other vertues, which doe ordinarily accompanie Clemencie, from

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whence cannot but ariſe the eſtate of a moſt perfect common-wealth. Therefore we reade, That in the time of the aforeſaid emperour <hi>Marcus Antonine,</hi> the world <note place="margin">Capit. in Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cel.</note> was commonly well reformed in good manners: for every man ſtudied to imitate him in his vertues, and eſpecially in his moderation and gentlenes; inſomuch (ſaith <hi>Capitolinus)</hi> as he made many good men of ſuch as were very bad before, and ſuch as were good, he made them better. This is alſo the cauſe why debonaire and gentle
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:21818:147"/>
princes are alwaies ſo praiſed and eſteemed, not onely by men of their time, but alſo

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by all Hyſtoriographers, and all poſteritie, becauſe they are ordinarily cauſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goods to all their ſubjects: as by contrarie, cruell princes are alwaies diffamed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their lives, and after their deaths, becauſe of great miſcheefes, whereof they are cauſe, authors and executors.

                     <l>To borders even of nations ſtrange alwaies.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But I doe well know, that hereupon the Machiavelliſts will ſay and replie, That if a <note place="margin">A princes Clemencie is not the cauſe of evill.</note> prince will be ſo facile, to pardon and to practiſe Clemencie, he will thereby incite men to take experience of that his vertue, and by conſequent provoke them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit evill and exceſſe, under the hope of impunitie: hereunto I anſwere in a tripar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite ſort: Firſt I ſay, That if a prince uſe Clemencie, without derogating from his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice (as above we have ſaid he ought to doe) there will follow no impunitie of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> crime, nor by conſequent any provocation to commit any exceſſe puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable: for juſtice ſhall alwayes have her courſe, although by Clemencie it may bee moderated. Secondly, ſuppoſe that the Clemencie of a prince might bee a meanes or occaſion unto men, to take more licenſe to doe evill, yet could not this take place but in perſons of evill nature: for men of good natures and diſpoſition will rather be incited by a princes clemencie to be good like him, by following his vertues, than to bee wicked and ungodly thereby: The prince alſo which ſhall bee endowed with Clemencie, will love and follow other vertues, and hate vices, and by conſequent will honour and advance vertuous people, and hate and recoile from him ſuch as are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: This will cauſe the wicked, which are enclined to vices, to guard themſelves

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> from committing puniſhable faults: for although they promiſe to themſelves an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, to entreat pardon for their faults by the princes Clemencie, yet can they not promiſe to themſelves to be beloved and entertained of him, but rather evill liked and unadvanced. Thirdly, although Clemencie cannot but draw with it ſome ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and injuſtice (as verily a prince cannot ſo evenly poiſe and weigh his affaires in the practiſe of Clemencie, but there will be alwaies found within them ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice) yet that evill which followeth Clemencie, is not ſo great, that we ought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore altogether to take away Clemencie from a prince, from whence proceeds infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit goods, profitable and commodious, as well to the prince himſelfe, and his eſtate, as to his ſubjects &amp; the whole commonwealth, as may eaſily be collected out of that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which hath been already ſaid, and ſhall be ſpoken hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The auncient Romanes doe confeſſe, that their facilitie to pardon, hath many <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Titus Livius lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Dec.</hi> 4.</note> times brought warres upon them, as alſo revoltments of their allies and confederats. But what then? Left they therefore alwayes to ſhew themſelves prompt and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to uſe Clemencie towards ſuch as offended them? nay rather it was the vertue, whereof they made greateſt eſtimation, and which they moſt practiſed, knowing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:21818:147"/>
well, that Clemencie was the true foundation of the greatneſſe and eſtate of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> commonwealth. And this is it which the embaſſadour of the Romanes ſpake in an aſſembly of the Aetolians (a people of Greece) which were ſollicited rather to allie themſelves with king <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedonie againſt the Romanes, than with them to renew their alliance. <q>Our aunceſtors (ſaith he) have often experimented, and we alſo have ſeene, that becauſe ever wee have beene eaſie to pardon, wee have occaſioned many to experiment our Clemencie; yet were wee never ſo diſcouraged, as we would not at all times uſe equalitie to ſuch as have broken their Faiths unto us, and ſuch as holily obſerved them, as alſo reaſon wills, that ſuch as are loyall and faithfull be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beloved, favoured and reſpected than others: Have wee nor warred upon the Samnites, by the ſpace of ſeaventie yeeres? and during this time, how many times

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> have they broken their Faiths? how many times have they riſen up againſt us? yet have wee alwaies received them for our allies, after, by marriages have wee come to an affinitie with them, and finally, wee have received them for concitizens into the the towne of Rome. The Capuans revoulted from us, to allie themſelves with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball;</hi> but after wee had beſieged them, there were more in the towne which ſlew themſelves, preſſed with an evill conſcience, than wee cauſed to dye, after we had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the towne by force, and left them their towne whole and their goods. Having alſo vanquiſhed <hi>Anniball,</hi> and the Carthaginians, which had done us ſo many miſchiefes and ſo often broken their Faiths, yet left wee them in peace and liberty. Briefely ô Aetolians (ſaid hee) you ſhould know and beleeve, that the Romane peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> will alwaies have Clemencie, in moſt ſingular recommendation, and you ſhall doe farre more for your ſelves, to replant your ſelves into our amitie and alliance, unles you love better to periſh with <hi>Phillip,</hi> than to vanquiſh and proſper with the Romanes.</q> Vnto this remonſtrance of the Romane embaſſadors, the Aetolians States would deliver no anſwere, but amongſt themſelves reſolved ſecretly, neither to be on the one ſide, nor the other, and that at the end of the warre, they would joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſtrongeſt, which in the end was their bane, yet found they refuge in the Romanes Clemencie: And verely Clemency is ſuch a vertue, as a prince may never diſpoyle himſelfe of, although ſometimes it ſeeme hee get harme thereby: For Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie is not cauſe of any evill, but onely the malice of men doth abuſe it; yet it

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> doth not therefore follow, that it is to bee rejected, becauſe a man may abuſe it, no more than to caſt away all wine, as a pernitious thing, becauſe therewith many are drunke: But let us now come to the other effect of Clemencie.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the effects whereof, wee have above diſcourſed, which are to temper the rigour of juſtice, to make the prince beloved, reverenced, and praiſed of all the world, and to fill his ſubjects with good manners, there are yet, three other effects worthie of note in a princes Clemencie, that thereby hee may bee better obeyed, more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in his eſtate, and may augment his domination: And to touch thoſe three points in order one after an other, I will preſuppoſe for the firſt point: That a prince makes himſelfe eaſily and well obeyed, when the wils of his ſubjects are of themſelves <note place="margin">A clement prince bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter obeyed.</note>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> well diſpoſed to yeeld obedience: But it is certaine, when a prince is debonaire and clement, that his ſubjects will bee alwaies well diſpoſed to obey him, for two reaſons: The one becauſe he ſhal be beloved, &amp; the amitie which his ſubjects beare him, ſhall incite and ſtirre them more willinglie to obey him; The other reaſon, becauſe being ſoft and gentle, his commands alſo are ſweet and gratious, founded upon reaſon and equitie, and this will cauſe them eaſily to yeeld obedience, becauſe there is nothing
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:21818:148"/>
that more enduceth a ſubject to render his prince obedience, and to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> than when themſelves do ſee and judge, that the commandement is both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable &amp; equall, for equitie is the ſinew of the commandement &amp; of the law, which makes it forcible and brings it into action, and without this equitie, the law cannot endure, nor long bee obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the lawes and ordinances which the Romanes, gave to the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Titus Livius lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Dec.</hi> 5.</note> after they had brought Macedonie under their obedience, endured very long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were in any thing chaunged or corrected: For they were ſo upright and convenient for that nation, as the uſage it ſelfe (ſaith <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> which is the true corrector of lawes) found nothing to reprehend or correct, by the experience of many yeeres. Very memorable alſo is the manner of the Romanes uſe, to make <note place="margin">How to make good lawes.</note> lawes, and eſpecially thoſe which they gave to the Macedonians: For they were not

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> contented to handle and deale with them in their Senate, to cut and ſtretch them after their fancies (as ſome doe at this day, which make lawes in their chambers with ſuch as themſelves) but elected ten delegates or deputies, wiſe and honourable men, which went all over Macedonie, to inquire and bee informed of the manners and conditions of the countrie people, and of their antient cuſtomes and liberties, and to have their peoples aduice of ſuch lawes as were fitteſt for them: By this meanes they made very covenable lawes for the nation of the Macedonians, which they found good, holy and equall, and they willingly obeyed and obſerved them, with good hearts, without any conſtraint: And aſſuredly this is the beſt meane when men makes new lawes and ordinances, that is to have the aduice of ſuch as are to have

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> &amp; obey them, to know of them the diſcommodities that by them may fall out, which they muſt needes know better than any other: And for this reaſon the antient kings of France, made their lawes and ordinances, by the advice of the States generall, or at the leaſt by the aſſemblie of a great number of barons, prelates, and wiſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of each great towne, of the kingdome, which aſſembly they called the kings great Counſell: And the Romane emperours, made their lawes by their Senates advice, as wee have in another place ſaid. And indeed it is a raſh preſumption of one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or a few men, to thinke they can make lawes of themſelves and covenable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, for a people and a nation, without having the advice of them of that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea of many &amp; of divers countries: The ancient Romanes were of a better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> than ſuch preſumptuous perſons, and they never received law, till it was well toſſed and handled, and till every one were hard ſpeake, that would either perſuade or diſuadethe law, which was to be enacted: Therefore (ſaith <hi>Titus Livius)</hi> it came often to paſſe, that the Tribunes (whoſe office it was to cauſe the law to bee received or rejected by the people) deſiſted from the receit of a law, being moved ſo to doe by the reaſons and remonſtrations of ſuch as diſuaded it: and often times alſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing themſelves againſt the reception of a law, they departed from their oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being moved thereunto by the reaſons of ſuch as perſuaded, and truely if the lawes and ordinances, which are made for the government of a kingdome or other

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> principallitie, were ſo well examined before they were concluded, and that everie man were heard, in a generall aſſembly of States, to perſuade or diſuade them, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſurd, and weake lawes, would not bee made as are, neither by conſequent would they bee ſo evill obſerved as they are: For they ſhould be made equall &amp; commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for ſuch as ſhould obey them, and ſo would each man obey them with good will, becauſe as is ſaid, Equitie is that which holdeth law in action &amp; obſervation.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſhake their eſtates, or prevaile againſt them, and eſpecially if that prince with his Clemencie, have about him a good Counſell: For his vertues will procure him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends of his neighbours, and make his ſubjects voluntarie and obeiſant; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as it ſhall be very eaſie for him to reſiſt the enterpriſes of ſuch as will invade &amp; ſet upon him. We reade, that the emperour <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was very modeſt, <note place="margin">Lampri. in Alex.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and ſo did his ſonne by the extreame avarice and arrogancie that was in her, which cauſed the death of them both. The ſame notable ſpeech of <hi>Alexander</hi> is attributed to <hi>Theopompus</hi> king of Sparta, who knowing, that the puiſſance of a king is good and <note place="margin">Plutarch in Apo.</note> excellent, when kings uſe it well: but becauſe there were farre more kings which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their powers, than that uſe them well, he provided for himſelfe and his ſucceſſors certaine Cenſors and correctors, to reprehend them of their faults, which were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ephori:</hi> Certaine then ſaid unto <hi>Theopompus,</hi> that by this eſtabliſhment of <hi>Ephori</hi> he had leſſened and enfeebliſhed his power: Nay then (ſaid he) I have fortified it, and made it perdurable, meaning to ſay (as true it is) that there is nothing which better fortifieth, nor which makes more firme and ſtable a princes eſtate, than when he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> himſelfe with ſuch a ſweet moderation, that even he ſubmits himſelfe to the obſervation of lawes and cenſures. The emperour <hi>Severus</hi> otherwiſe endowed with <note place="margin">Spart. &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on. in Carac.</note> many great vertues, had not this good, to be debonaire and clement, but rather was rigorous and cruell: yet he knew well, and himſelfe confeſſed, that Clemencie is a vertue moſt worthie of a prince, and he much deſired to bee ſo eſteemed, although his actions were contrarie. I know well, that here the Machiavelliſts may reply upon me, that he faigned and only made a ſhew, to eſteeme of Clemencie, upon a certain kind of playing the Fox, and diſſimulation, which <hi>Machiavell</hi> holdeth to be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for a prince: Here unto I make a double anſwere: And I ſay, ſuppoſe in this place <hi>Severus</hi> meant to play the Fox, yet when he ſo much praiſeth Clemencie, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſo faine would ſeeme clement, he therby ſeemes to approve that vertue, as both low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and good. Secondly, I ſay, that it is credible, that <hi>Severus,</hi> although he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſanguinarie and cruell during his raigne, yet in the end he found, that it had been better for him, if he had been <hi>Clement:</hi> for with his owne eyes he ſaw <hi>Plautia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his greateſt and eſpecialleſt friend, and <hi>Baſsianus</hi> his eldeſt ſon (whom with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he aſſociated in the empire) both of them (though not together) conſpire to ſlay him; inſomuch, as he durſt not puniſh them, becauſe they had learned of him to be ſanguinarie and cruell: and at the end of his dayes, the laſt words hee ſpake, were, That he left the empire firme and aſſured to his <hi>Antonines</hi> (meaning <hi>Baſsianus</hi> and <hi>Geta,</hi> which he named <hi>Antonines,</hi> that they might be beloved) provided, that they proved good princes: but if they were wicked and cruell, then he left them weak

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and evill aſſured: And indeede theſe laſt words were as a prophecie to his children: For <hi>Baſsianus</hi> his eldeſt ſonne (who ſucceeded him in the empire) was as cruell as he, and begun to exerciſe his crueltie, in ſlaying with his owne hand <hi>Geta</hi> his brother, and after continued it upon his friends and other notable people a great number, which he brought to their deaths: and therefore was not his foot long in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21818:150"/>
but (according as his father prophecied of his death) hee was ſoone deſpoyled

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thereof, and of his life withall: for he was ſlaine by <hi>Macrinus</hi> his lieutenant, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but nine and twentie yeares, whereof he raigned ſixe. The emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> alſo was a very cruell prince, yet he greatly praiſed Clemencie in a prince, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, when he reaſoned upon any affaire in the Senat, he often enterlaced amongſt his ſpeeches ſome commendations of his owne Clemencie, although he was moſt cruell and wicked. And breefely, we may ſay and conclude, that this vertue of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie is ſo excellent and lowable of it ſelfe, that even the wicked, which reject it, are notwithſtanding conſtrained to have it in eſtimation, and to confeſſe it is a vertue worthie of a prince.</p>
                  <p>From the beginning that Rome was reduced into the forme of a commonweale,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſervice. This cauſe finally comming in deliberation in the Senate houſe, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Publicola</hi> (who was one of them which helped away the tyrant from Rome) ſpoke thus: This the uſurers rigorous dealing, is but a new tyrannie: and it is but a ſmall thing for us to have expulſed from Rome the tyrannie of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> if now wee will eſtabliſh another: &amp; that it was too unreaſonable, that ſouldiers ſhould pay intereſts running on, whileſt they ſerved the commonwealth, ſince alſo they ſerved without wages. Therefore he exhorted the Senate to releeve the people of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts for their content, and that afterward they might with ſo much the better will ſerve the commonweale at a need: For els (ſaith he) certaine it is, if there be a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this rigorous dealing, it will bring the people into a great diſobedience, &amp;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> a ſedition into the commonwealth, the eſtate wherof by this means may be ſhrewdly ſhaken and hazarded: But if the people be kindly and graciouſly uſed in acquiting them of the ſaid intereſts, by this meanes you ſhall make moſt aſſured the eſtate of the citie.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> entertained and uſed him very honourably, knowing that that great <hi>Scipio</hi> was of ſuch Clemencie, that he would never forget, that the pleaſure and that the amitie of ſo great a perſonage might ſtand him in good ſtead in ſome great neceſſities, as loſſe of a battaile, or of a captivitie, or ſuch like. Not long after <hi>Scipio</hi> fell ſicke, whereof <hi>Antiochus</hi> hearing, he ſent him his ſonne without ranſome, fearing <hi>Scipio</hi> would die with greefe and melancholie, by whoſe death he doubted to leeſe a good refuge: For that king (ſaith <hi>Titus Livius)</hi> truſted more in the Clemencie and authoritie of <hi>Scipio</hi> alone, for the uncertaine and doubtfull haps of warre, than in his armie of 60000 footmen, and 12000 horſemen. Is not here, thinke you, an admirable effect of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, that an enemie dooth better aſſure his eſtate upon his enemies Clemencie,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> than upon his owne forces?</p>
                  <p>But what need we any more to amplifie by examples or authorities this point? doth not ordinarie experience ſhew, and ever hath done, that all good and clement princes have alwaies been very aſſured in their eſtates: as <hi>Augustus, Veſpaſian, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, Adrian,</hi> the <hi>Antonines,</hi> and many other Romane emperours, and the moſt part of our kings of Fraunce, which were clement and debonaire, doe fully proove this which I ſay: for they raigned very peaceably; died of naturall deaths; and after their deaths were greatly lamented of the people. Here I may not forget a notable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the emperour <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> which hee received from <hi>Scipio</hi> the Affrican, <note place="margin">

Are not theſe people worthie to commaund? Neither make they any account more of their princes ſubjects, than of ſlaves, which men may beat, ſcourge, or ſley at their pleaſure, as beaſts: as indeed there hath been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a burne-paper-fellow, a writer for wages, one of theſe Machiaveliſts, who durſt publiſh by writing, That the authority of a prince over his ſubjects, is like that which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a lord hath over his villaine and ſlave, having power over death and life, to ſley and maſſacre them at their pleaſure without forme of juſtice, and ſo to deſpoile them of their goods. And how comes this? Thinkes this ſot, that the office of a king is like to the office of a gally captaine, to hold his ſubjects in chaines, and every day to whip them with ſcourges? Surely, they which hold that opinion, doe merit to be ſo handled, yea, that ſome good gally captaine would twice or thrice a day practiſe that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21818:151"/>
goodly doctrine upon their ſhoulders: but how much more notable and humane, is

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the doctrine wee learne of the life of <hi>Augustus Caeſar?</hi> who ſo much feared, that men had ſuch an opinion of him, that he would not take away, but onely diminiſh the libertie of the people, that he could never abide and ſuffer to be called <hi>Dominus,</hi> that is to ſay, Lord, but abhorred it as an injurious name, &amp; full of opprobry, becauſe it hath ſome relation to <hi>Servus,</hi> which is to ſay, ſervant, or ſlave: he being farre from the affectation of ſuch great and magnificall names, as many great men have ſince well liked of, without ſhewing the effect of them.</p>
                  <p>The third point now remaineth, which is to ſhew, That the Clemencie of a prince <note place="margin">A prince by Clemencie encreaſeth his domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Dioniſ. Halic. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Plutarke in Caeſar &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexand.</hi>

For ſtraight as their king begins to ſtirre and goe out, his ſubjects remoove withall; ſo that oftentimes by

                  <p>By theſe examples then it is evidently ſeene, That Covetouſneſſe is cuſtomably the cauſe of the ruine of ſuch princes and great lords as are infected therewith: ſo farre is it off, that it is profitable, as <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith: Yet true it is, that there have been ſome (but very few) which being covetous, notwithſtanding have not been ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated by that vice; as the emperour <hi>Veſpaſian:</hi> but the reaſon wherefore the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was not cauſe of his deſtruction, is for that he exerciſed it not <note place="margin">

The other excuſe is yet more conſiderable, that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> employed not upon his owne pleaſures and delights, the ſilver which his covetouſneſſe had colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but beſtowed it on good uſes for the good of the commonwealth.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> cauſed to die during thoſe civill wars; &amp; withall, that a prince cannot ſo well governe, but there will be alwaies mailcontents and complainers. There is this moreover, that this change of eſtate which you have brought into the commonweale, by reducing it into a monarchie, makes, that a man cannot well aſſure himſelfe of ſuch as they eſteeme to be their friends: yet I beſeech you (my good lord) to excuſe me, if I a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple woman take that hardineſſe to tel you my advice upon this matter: which is, that I thinke there is nothing impoſſible to repreſſe by ſoft and gentle meanes: for the natures of ſuch as are enclined to do evill, are ſooner ſubdued and corrected by uſing clemencie and beneficence towards them, than ſeveritie: For princes which are courteous and mercifull, make themſelves not onely agreeable and honourable to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> them upon whom they beſtow mercie, but alſo towards all others. And by contrary, ſuch as are inexorable, and will abate nothing of their rigour, are hated and blamed not only of them, towards whom he ſhewes himſelfe ſuch, but of all others alſo. See you not (my good lord) that either never or very ſelde phyſicians come to cut the ſicke members of the bodie, but onely ſeeke to heale them by ſoft and gentle mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments? in like ſort are maladies of the ſpirit to be healed: And the gentle medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

It is alſo a very requiſit thing in a prince, not only to do no wrong to any perſon, but alſo to be reputed ſuch a man as will never do wrong to any man; becauſe that is the meane to have the amitie and benevolence of men, which a prince can never obtaine, unleſſe he doe perſuade them, that he will do well to the good, and that hee will doe wrong to none: For feare may well bee acquired with force, but amitie cannot bee obtained but by perſuaſion: ſo that if it pleaſe you (my lord) to uſe benefits and liberalitie towards ſuch as you eſteeme your enemies,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and towards ſuch as feare, you will doe them wrong, you ſhall eaſily gaine them and others from henceforth for your friends.</q> This remonſtrance of <hi>Livia</hi> was the cauſe that <hi>Augustus</hi> let looſe and ſet at liberrie all them which were accuſed to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſed any thing againſt him, ſatisfying himſelf with the admoniſhments he gave them, and beſides gave great goods and benefits unto ſome of them, ſo that as well thoſe as other of his enemies became his friends and good ſubjects. Behold heere what good came to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> by his beneficence and liberalitie.</p>
                  <p>The emperour <hi>Marcus Antonine</hi> feared nothing more than the reputation of an hard and covetous man, and alwayes wiſhed and deſired, that ſuch a ſpot of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie <note place="margin">Dion. in Marco.</note> might never bee impoſed upon him: And indeede, all his carriage and actions

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> were ſuch, that none could impute unto him any ſpot of Covetouſneſſe, but al Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie worthie of a good prince: for firſt hee eſtabliſhed publicke profeſſours of all ſciences in the towne of Athens, unto which he gave great wages, which prooved a moſt profitable act to the commonweale, woorthie of ſuch a prince: and this was partly the cauſe, that in his time there was ſo great ſtore of learned people in all manner of ſciences: inſomuch, as the time of his kingdome was and hath ben ſince called the golden world. In our time, king <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of happie memorie, did imitate the example of this great and wiſe emperour, eſtabliſhing publicke lectures at great wages in the Vniverſitie of Paris, a thing wherof his memorie hath ben and ſhall be more celebrated through the world, than for ſo many great warres as hee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſuſtained and demeaned, during his raigne. Secondly, the emperour <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi> forgave the people all the fiſcall debts and arrerages which they ought him, by ſcedules, obligations, or otherwiſe for fiftie yeares before, which was an huge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable liberalitie: But he did this to take away all meanes &amp; matter, from all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and fiſcall procurators, of moleſting and troubling his ſubjects afterward with reſearches and calling on of old debts. Thirdly, hee never laid impoſt or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie exaction upon his people, but handled them in all kindneſſe and generoſitie: He never made profuſe and ſuperfluous expences, but held an eſtate both at home and in the court, ſober and full of frugalitie: And finally, to ſhew how he delighted in liberalitie, he cauſed a temple to be builded to <hi>Beneficence.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold here a true patterne, after which princes ſhould conforme themſelves to know how to practiſe that goodly vertue, Liberalitie: And very notable is that point that that good emperour <hi>Antonine</hi> held the eſtate of his houſe ruled by frugalitie and ſobrietie, and farre from the ſtraunge profuſions of thoſe monſters, <hi>Caligula, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius:</hi> for he conſidered, that it were much better to employ for the publicke wealth of his empire; the revenues and money therof, than in riotouſneſſe
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:21818:160"/>
and vanities; and that ſuch unmeaſurable profuſion conſtraineth a prince to fall to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> rapines, and to deale evill with their ſubjects, becauſe (as the common proverb ſaith) Vnmeaſurable largeſſe hath no bottome. Therefore did that great emperour <hi>Traian</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Dion in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iano. Lampr. in Alex. Spar in Andria.</note> alſo hould his eſtate ſoberly governed, and hee maintained no unprofitable perſons in his ſervice. No more did the emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> who would not ſuffer in any offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces any perſons to be placed, which were not neceſſarie: They had alſo good ſallaries and rewards of him, yea, he would often rebuke them, for not demaunding gifts of him: And wherefore (ſaith he) wilt thou, that I ſhould be thy debter, ſeeing thou as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt me nothing. <hi>Adrian</hi> alſo had this propertie, that hee gave great gifts unto his good friends and ſervants, and made them rich, before they demaunded any thing: And above all, hee was liberall towards profeſſors of letters, and learned men, which he enriched: but he much hated ſuch as by evill meanes became rich, and generally

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> all good emperours were adorned with the vertues of liberalitie and munificence, which they practiſed with ſuch moderation and prudence, that they were never ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither with <hi>Machiavels</hi> Covetouſneſſe, nor his Prodigalitie: And therefore they flouriſhed and proſpered during their raignes, and left after them a perpetuall memorie to poſteritie of their vertues and praiſes.</p>
                  <p>Our kings of Fraunce, as <hi>Clovis, Charlemaigne, Lewis</hi> the piteous his ſonne, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Henry</hi> the firſt, <hi>Lewis le Gros, Lewis</hi> the eight, S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and many others, were very liberall, but they exerciſed their liberalitie and principalitie upon the Church and Churchmen, which they but too much enriched. Yet wee reade, that <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne</hi> was alſo very liberall towards learned men, and that he ſpent much in foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and maintaining the Vniverſitie of Paris. And a man may generally marke in our kings of Fraunce, a Chriſtian liberalitie, which they have alwayes had, that is, That they have been great Almoniers, exerciſing their liberalitie upon poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is an exerciſe of that vertue, exceeding woorthie of a Chriſtian prince, which he ſhould never forget.</p>
                  <p>By this aboveſaid, I hope the Maxime of <hi>Machiavell</hi> is ſufficiently confuted, and that it evidently appeareth by our examples and reaſons, That Covetouſneſſe is domageable and diſhonourable to a prince, as alſo is his contrarie profuſion, and that Liberalitie is profitable and honourable unto him: And as for the reaſons which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                     <hi>Machiavell</hi> alledgeth, they are fooliſh and falſe, as his Maxime: For to ſay, That a rich prince ſhall be eſteemed puiſſant, becauſe he hath great treaſures, that reaſon dooth evill conclude. King <hi>Perſeus</hi> of Macedonie (of whome wee have ſpoken) had <note place="margin">The power of a prince lieth not in treaſures.</note> great treaſures, yet left he not to be eſteemed a king puſillanimous and of ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſuch was his reputation in his owne countrey, and amongſt his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>Craſsus</hi> alſo was knowne to be more richer than <hi>Pompeius;</hi> but he was not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo valiant nor ſo good a man, neither in his life had hee the tenth part of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peies</hi> honours. <hi>Mauricius</hi> and <hi>Phocas</hi> Romane emperours, by their covetouſneſſe heaped up great treaſures; but were they therefore eſteemed puiſſant and valiant? nay contrarie they were eſteemed cowards, and in the catalogue of ſuch emperours

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> as held the moſt abject and infamous places.</p>
                  <p>But I pray you let us come to the reaſon. When a prince hath the fame to bee a great treaſurer, doth he not give his neighbours occaſion to ſeeke meanes to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe upon him to obtain thoſe treaſures? Wherfore is it, that the Venetians (which if they liſt, might bee the greateſt treaſurers of the world) have made a law amongſt <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De Con. l. b.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</note> them, to have no treaſure in their commonwealth, other than of armes? It is becauſe
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:21818:160"/>
they know well (as they be wiſe) that if they heape up treaſures in money, they ſhall

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but prepare a bait to draw rheir neighbours on to make warre upon them: but warres come too ſoone, and under the pretext of more occaſions than we would, therefore we need no baits to draw it upon us. It is not then beſt for a prince to bee reputed a man full of treaſures and ſilver, as <hi>Machiavell</hi> thinketh: for money of it ſelfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſerve us for a bait to attract and draw upon us them which are hungry and deſirous of it. And although commonly, money is thought to be the ſinewes of war, yet are they not ſo neceſſarily required, that without money warre cannot bee made. I will not here alledge the poore Hugonet ſouldiors, which moſt commonly warred without wages: but I will onely alledge the militarie eſtate which was in the Roman empire in the emperour <hi>Valentinians</hi> time, and ſince: For in that time the militarie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> art was ſo policied, that every ſouldior tooke for a moneth ſo much bread, ſo much wine, ſo much larde, and ſo much of other neceſſarie things: His habites alſo were new from tearmeto tearme, and all other things neceſſarie, ſo that he touched either none or very little money, yet had he all that he wanted. And indeede, money ſerves but for commutation: for men cannot eat it, nor apparrell themſelves with it, nor if he be ſicke, can it heale him: Wherefore then ſerves it? For a prompt, quicke, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie commutation: For if you have money, you ſtraight have whatſoever you neede: If then by other meanes and policie order be taken, that a ſouldior have all he needs (as was done in <hi>Valentinians</hi> time, and others) it will be found, that money makes not a prince puiſſant. Moreover, I doe confeſſe, that it is certaine, that in the militarie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which we have at this day, which is, that a ſouldior ſhall receive in money all he needeth, that money is very neceſſarie, and that without it a man can doe no great thing, and that they are as ſinewes, or as the maintenance of the ſinewes of warre, but yet by good husbandrie a prince may have ſufficient of it, and without Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>As for that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> makes no account of, that a prince bee reputed to be a Mechanique, I leave it to them to thinke which have, I will not ſay, the heart of a prince, but onely of a ſimple gentleman, that hath honour but in a little recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, if they would not bee greeved to bee reputed a mechanique perſon. I know well, that the nobilitie of Italie, which more commonly trade and deale with

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> marchandize, than with armes, care not for that name of a mechanique, ſo they may get money: But the gentlemen of Fraunce, of Almaigne, of England, and of other countries of Chriſtendome, are not of the humor of that mechanique nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, neither would they for any thing in the world be ſo reputed, as <hi>Machiavel</hi> would perſuade them.</p>
                  <p>And as for the examples which <hi>Machiavell</hi> alledgeth of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> and of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> king of Spaine, which (he ſaid) were covetous, yet effected great matters: I anſwere him in one word, That it prooveth nothing of that hee ſaith: for Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> made no great proweſſes not conqueſts, as every man knoweth: and king <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in the exploits and enterpriſes of warres was not covetous, for any thing we reade in

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hyſtories: And if that were true which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith of thoſe two, I will oppoſe alwayes againſt thoſe two obſcure examples, them above alledged, which are farre more illuſtrious and notable, and by the which I have ſhewed, that Covetouſneſſe hath alwayes been pernicious to princes; and Liberalitie without profuſion, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and honourable.</p>
                  <p>For a reſolution then of this matter, I ſay, That the vice of Ingratitude accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21818:161"/>
ordinarily covetouſneſſe, and that none can bee covetous and illiberall, unleſſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he will proove ingrate to his friends and good ſervants, which is one of the greateſt vices, wherewith a prince can bee noted: For it is impoſſible that his affaires can bee well governed, without good and loyall miniſters and ſervants, ſuch as hee can never have, being ingrate: Therefore a prince ought well to ingrave perpetually in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, the ſentence of king <hi>Bochus,</hi> who ſaid, It was leſſe diſhonourable, for a prince to bee vanquiſhed by armes, than by munificence: And therefore that good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <note place="margin">Saluſt in bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Iugurth.</note> 
                     <hi>Titus,</hi> whenſoever he paſſed any day, without exerciſing ſome liberalitie and beneficence, ſaid to his friends: O my friends, I have loſt this day, meaning that that was the chiefe marke, at which a prince ſhould ſhoot, to wit, Beneficence, and that otherwiſe hee emploies his time evill.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> be the beſt &amp; moſt vertuous man in the citie: When then it came in queſtion, who was the beſt in all the towne; every man (ſaith <hi>Titus Livius)</hi> deſired the lot might fall upon him, and theere was not any, but he loved better to be elected the beſt man <note place="margin">The title of a good man more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Romanes, than to be Conſull or Dictator.</note> of the citie, than to bee choſen either Conſul or Dictator, or into any other great eſtate: The election fell upon <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> (cooſin germane of the Affrican) who was a young man, but a very good man, and the ſonne of a good father; who went to receive that old goddeſſe of ſtone, mother of the Gods: But I doe demand of you, if thoſe good Romanes, had beene inſtructed in the doctrine of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> and had learned of this Maxime, That it is not good to make a ſtraight profeſſion of a good man; would they ſo much have wiſhed, that this election had fallen upon

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> them and preferred this title of a good man, before ſo high dignities of a Conſull or Dictator? certainely no: but they which hould contrary to the doctrine of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavell,</hi> make more eſtimation of goodneſſe and vertue, than of the greateſt riches and dignities.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, there is nothing more certaine, but that it is the goodlieſt and moſt honourable title, that a man can poſſibly have, To bee a good man: And let it not diſpleaſe great lords, which are imbarked in the higheſt title of honours of Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Marſhals, Admirals, Chancelors, Preſidents, Knights of the order, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and Lieutenants of the king, and other like great States: for all thoſe titles, without the title of a good man, valew nothing, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> indeed are but ſmokes to ſtifle them which have them: But I confeſſe, that if they have the title of a good man, with theſe titles, then are they worthie of double honour, and to bee beloved and reſpected of all the world.</p>

                  <p>But I will not long ſtay in refuting this Maxime, for I thinke I have before ſo well beaten downe thoſe degrees, whereby hee would have princes aſcend to that

utilitie: Thus doth he change himſelfe by little and little, and ſo from good ſhal

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he become wicked, and none perceive it: And it is good to bee noted, the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which <hi>Machiavell</hi> makes of the chaunge and varietie of manners, by the chaunce of colours: For as blacke never takes white well, his contrarie, unleſſe firſt white bee tainted with ſome other colour, as blew or red: So the chaunge (ſaith <hi>Machiavell)</hi> from good to wicked, is never made unto any good purpoſe, without ſome pretext and ſhew, which gives to a man an appearance betwixt good and evill.</p>
                  <p>Here is a ſingular precept in the art of wickedneſſe, To become wicked, and yet the world ſhall not perceive it: for if the world know it, then it is an ignorance of the art which wills a knowledge, well to diſſemble, and that a man ſhould bee apt and fit to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> know handſomely, to faine and deale, with his viſage and countenance, to deceive men: By joyning then together theſe two precepts, To be a diſſembler, and to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to doe evill, it will follow, that this Maxime is very proper for this art: for it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth how to doe to become wicked, and not diſcover himſelfe to be ſo, but alwayes to obſerve the pretext of diſſimulation.</p>
                  <p>You ſee then (and he that ſees not is very blind of ſence and underſtanding) that this abhominable Florentine perſevereth ſtill to teach a prince the art of wickednes: But for ſo much as before we have diſputed againſt all the kinds thereof, as likewiſe againſt hypocriſie and diſſimulation, I will ſpeake no more hereof. And as for the example of <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> one of the tenne potentates of Rome, which <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avell</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> alledgeth, ſerves nothing for his purpoſe: For <hi>Appius</hi> exerciſing an office which endured but a yeare, carried himſelfe well for that firſt yeare, which was the cauſe that he and his companions were continued in their eſtate another yeare: but with great difficultie obtained they that continuation; for it was as it were a breach of their law to continue an office to any perſon more than a yeare: <hi>Appius</hi> ſeeing, that it ſhould be impoſſible to obtaine of the Romane people, a continuation for a third yeare, thought it good now to make himſelfe feared, by ſeeking to obtaine his eſtate by force: and like ynough he had gotten againe his office, had there not happened a warre againſt the Romanes, which came nigh unto them: and therefore <hi>Appius</hi> and his companions, could doe no leſſe (if it were but to defend themſelves) than

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> levie an armie: but none would obey them, becauſe the time of their offices was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and that they acknowledged them no more for lawfull magiſtrates: ſo that for want of obedience they were conſtrained to forſake their offices, &amp; to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the peoples mercie, who ſet in priſon <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> and <hi>Spurius Oppius,</hi> where they died, and baniſhed the other eight, and confiſcated their goods. The cauſe then why <hi>Appius</hi> could not obtaine the tyrannie which hee had enterpriſed, was not, for that hee changed too ſuddainely from good to wicked, but becauſe the time of his office being expired, he could not be obeyed: and herein, all the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations and foxlike dealings of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> could have done him no good: for as ſoone as any mans office was expired at Rome, hee that held it, muſt come out, were

                  <p>Moreover, this Maxime here, is not onely wicked, but alſo hard to practiſe: For very difficult it is, that a man ſhould change from a good man to a wicked, and not bee perceived, though in his actions he uſe many palliations and diſſimulations: For amongſt people there are alwayes ſome one which is not a beaſt, but (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe is) can know flies in the milke, and which ſtraight can diſcover the diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

This counſell of <hi>Appius</hi> was many times followed, but in the end they found it did them no good: For after the Tribunes were partialized one againſt another, and that thereby nothing could paſſe nor be concluded by way of deliberation and accuſtomed ſuffrages, then fell they to armes and ſeditions: So that in the end the people were conſtrained by force to plucke from the Patricians, that which they would not permit to bee handled and diſputed, by the accuſtomed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> way of good deliberation and concluſion by pluralitie of voices. Thus oftentimes the Patricians were conſtrained (to appeaſe the people) to grant them things which by reaſon they might have perſuaded them to leave: for it is the nature of men to deſire alwayes that which is denied them, as the Poet <hi>Horace</hi> ſayth very well, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that which happeneth ordinarily in the world:</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Moreover, it often came to paſſe, that the Patricians deſired to make paſſe to the people (by meanes of the Tribunes) ſome law, which ſeemed unto them profitable for the commonwealth, but they could not come to their pretences, becauſe they had faſhioned the Tribunes to a contradiction one of another: And of thoſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunarie partialities aroſe at Rome, great inſurrections of the people, and great mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and effuſion of blood, as there did, when the two brethren <hi>Graccht</hi> were ſlain: And therefore that goodly counſell of <hi>Appius</hi> (whereupon <hi>Machiavell</hi> hath made

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his Maxime) was cauſe of great evils and calamities, as ſurely it is eaſie to judge, That all Partialities and diviſions are cauſe of ruine and deſolation amongſt a people: whereof we are alſo advertiſed by him who is truth it ſelfe, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſaith, That every kingdome divided in it ſelfe, ſhall be deſolate. And if there be any Machiaveliſt ſo groſſe headed, as hee cannot comprehend this in his ſpirit, yet may he ſee this by experience in Fraunce, if he be not altogether blind: and if hee be French, he cannot but palpably touch it in the loſſe of his goods, and in the death of his parents and friends, unleſſe he be a lazer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or without ſence: For all the late ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of Fraunce, from whence have they proceeded, but from the partialities of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Hugenots, which ſtrangers ſowed and maintained thereof. It is ſolly to ſay,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that the diverſitie of Religion was cauſe thereof: For if men had handled all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion, by preachings, diſputes, and conferences, as at the beginning they did, they had never falne into any Partialitie: but ſince men came to armes and maſſacres, and that, by conſtraint they will force men to beleeve, partialities ſprung up, which was the onely marke whereat all ſtrangers ſhot, that thereby they might plant in Fraunce the government of <hi>Machiavell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chalcedonians were well adviſed, not to beleeve the counſell of the Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which reſembled this doctrine of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> and the counſell of <hi>Appius:</hi> for when the warre was open betwixt the Romanes and the king <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians, allies and friends of the Romanes, cauſed to be aſſembled the States of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their countries, to reſolve upon that which <hi>Antiochus</hi> made them underſtand, That his onely comming into Greece, was to deliver the countrey from the ſubjection and ſervitude of the Romanes, and therefore required them to allie and conjoyne themſelves with him. The Aetolians (which were very unconſtant and mutable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with each wind, as are the Machiaveliſts) chanced to be in that aſſembly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded the Chalcedonians, that it was certaine, that the king <hi>Antiochus</hi> had paſſed from Aſia into Europe, to deliver Greece from the Romanes ſervitude, and that they thought it beſt, that all the cities of Greece ought to allie and contract amitie with both the two parties, the Antiochs and the Romanes: For (ſaid they) if wee allie our ſelves with both parties, when the one would offend us, the other will revenge us.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> The Chalcedonians not finding good this counſell of the Aetolians, knowing well, that as none can ſerve two contrary maſters, ſo neither can they allie themſelves with two nations enemies, and that they which will entertaine two contrarie parties, ſhall often fall into the malegrace of both: And therefore <hi>Mixtion,</hi> one of the principals amongſt the Chalcedonians, made to the Aetolians a very wiſe and notable anſwere: <q>Wee ſee not (maſters Aetolians, ſay they) that the Romanes have ſeized upon any
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:21818:166"/>
towne in Greece, neither that therein they have placed any Romane gariſon, nor that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> any payeth them tribute, neither know we any, unto whome they have given any law, or any thing changed their eſtate: And therefore we do not acknowledge our ſelves entangled in any ſervitude, but that we alwaies are in the ſame libertie which we have alwayes been: Being therefore free, we ſtand in no need of a deliverer, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the king <hi>Antiochus</hi> into Greece, cannot but hurt us, who can performe no greater good unto us, than to withdraw himſelfe farre from our countrey: And as for us, we are reſolved to receive none within our townes, but by the authority of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, our allies.</q> The Chalcedonians then governed themſelves after this anſwere, and it happened well unto them. But the Aetolians were almoſt all ruined and loſt by practiſing their fooliſh opinion, to entertaine both the Romanes and Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians, together: for ſo were they of neceſſitie forced to ſeeke practiſes, alwayes to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> maintaine warre betwixt that king and the Romane commonweale, to the end, that the two powers might alwayes ſtand on foot, without abilitie one to overthrow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe otherwiſe could they not attaine to their deſſeigne and purpoſe, which was to keepe themſelves in friendſhip with both parties: yet thus ſeeking and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſuſtaine them both, and maintaine them enemies, they made themſelves ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of both: So that after the retreat of <hi>Antiochus</hi> into his countrey, theſe miſerable Aetolians fell into a deſperate caſe, like to have torne one another in pieces, burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and accuſing mutually one another to be the inventors of that wicked counſell: yet in the end, by the Romanes clemencie and bountie, which pardoned them, they

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> had a certaine ſubſiſtence, though in a meane ſort.</p>
                  <p>In the towne of Ardea, a neighbour of the Romanes, there was a like partialitie, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Titus Livius lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Dec.</hi> 1.</note> as there is at this day at Genes: for now at Genes the people is banded againſt the nobles, and they will by no meanes receive any for duke of Genes of the nobilitie; inſomuch, as all dukes of Genes muſt needs be villaines and baſe men of race, and it may be there will be found in France of the like race, as at Genes: The like partialitie (I ſay) being in the towne of Ardea, betwixt the nobilitie and the people, it happened that two young batchelers, one of the people, and another of the nobilitie, fell at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate one againſt another, about the obtaining in marriage a yong maid of excellent beautie, but of a baſe and carterly race: Great bandying there fell out about this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they of the nobilitie all caſting their heads, and employing their abilities for

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> their gentleman, who loved and deſired that maid; and they obtained ſo much, as they got the maids mother on their ſide, who affected, that her doughter might bee placed in a noble houſe: But contrarie, the people which were for the other young man of their owne race and qualitie, did ſo much for him, as they gained the maids tutors, which thought, that it was more reaſonable, that their pupill ſhould eſpouſe an husband of her own qualitie, than to mount into an higher degree: for that equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ought (as much as might be) to bee obſerved in marriage: Vpon altercation of this marriage, the parties were drawn unto juſtice, and the maid was adjudged to the gentleman, after the advice of the mother: yet although by law the gentleman got

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the cauſe, by force he could not: for the tutors with ſtrong hand forced the maid from her mother: The gentleman unto whom ſhe was adjudged, being almoſt enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at this tape and injurie that was done him, gathered together a great companie of other gentlemen, his parents and friends, and gave charge upon thoſe which had taken away his betrothed wife: Breefely, there was a great ſtirre and noiſe through the towne, and a great number ſlaine on both ſides; and at laſt the gentlemen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:21818:166"/>
maſters of the towne, and the people were driven away: The people ſtraying

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> about the fields, ruinated the houſes and poſſeſſions of the nobles: The aboveſaid nobles ſent to Rome, embaſſadors for ſuccours: The people likewiſe ſent to the Volſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques (people of Tuſcane) for their aid: By this meanes the Romanes and the Volſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques fell to warre one againſt another: But the Romanes carrying away the victory, beheaded the principall authors of the inſurrection, which happened for this marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the towne of Ardea, and confiſcated all their goods, which was adjudged to the communaltie of the Ardeates. Here you ſee how the partialitie which was in the towne of Ardea, was cauſe of that great calamitie and combuſtion: and therefore well to be noted, are theſe words of <hi>Titus Livius:</hi> The Ardeates (ſaith he) were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in an inteſtine warre, the cauſe and commencement whereof proceeded of the contention

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of partialities, which alwaies have and will bee ruinous and domageable to people farre more than externe warres, than famine, than peſtilence, or than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils, which the gods doe ſend upon citties, which they will altogether deſtroy. Theſe words are full contrarie to the Machiaveline doctrine, as indeed they are the words of another manner of author than <hi>Machiavell,</hi> at whome I doe much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, that he dare attempt to write diſcourſes upon <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> ſince any may ſee, be underſtands him not, and his doctrine is alſo cleane contrarie to that of <hi>Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi> Vnto the ſaid ſentence of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> I will adde that which he reciteth from <hi>Quintius Capitolinus,</hi> who admoniſhing the ſouldiors of his armie: <q>Our enemies (ſaid hee) come not to aſſaile us upon any truſt they have in our cowardize or their

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> owne vertue, for many times alreadie they have aſſayed both the one and the other; but it is for the confidence they have in our partialities and contentions which now are betwixt the Patricians and the people: for our partialities are the venome which empoyſoneth and corrupteth this citie, becauſe we are too imperious, and you too unmeaſurably deſirous of libertie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The partialities of the Carthaginians, were they not cauſe of their utter ruine? There were two factions at Carthage, the Barchinian (whereof was <hi>Annibals</hi> houſe) <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Titus Livius lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Dec.</hi> 3.</note> and the <hi>Hannoenne</hi> contrarie. As ſoone as <hi>Amilcar</hi> the father of <hi>Anniball,</hi> was dead, the Carthaginians elected for captaine generall of their armie, <hi>Aſdruball</hi> their citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, one of the Barchian faction, which they ſent to make war in Spaine with a great armie.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> This <hi>Aſdruball</hi> had learned his art of warre under <hi>Amilcar,</hi> which was the cauſe why he ſought to have <hi>Anniball</hi> nigh him (who at that time was very yong) to adminiſter unto him the ſame benefit which he had received at his fathers hands, and therefore writ to the Senate of Carthage. The Senate brought this to deliberation, and <hi>Hanno</hi> his advice being demanded, he reaſoned in this ſort: <q>Maſters (ſaid he) me thinkes the demaund of <hi>Aſdruball</hi> is very equall, yet I am not of opinion, his re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queſt ſhould be graunted him: For it is equall in that hee deſireth to reſtore a like benefit to the ſonne, as he hath received of the father: yet may not we herein accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves to his will, and give him our youth to nouriſh after his fancie. I am then of advice, that this young <hi>Anniball</hi> be nouriſhed and educated in this cittie,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> under the obedience of lawes and magiſtrates, and that he be learned to live after juſtice, and in egalitie with others, leaſt this little fire do one day raiſe up a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q> The wiſeſt and beſt adviſed of the Senate were of this opinion, but the pluralitie (which was of the Barchian faction) was to ſend young <hi>Anniball</hi> into Spaine to the warre, who as ſoone as he came there, was much beloved of the ſouldiors; as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he reſembled his father <hi>Amilcar,</hi> as for his militarie vertues. Not many yeares
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:21818:167"/>
after, he was choſen captaine generall of the Carthaginian armie: But as ſoone as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he was ſetled in that eſtate, he accompliſhed the propheſie of <hi>Hanno,</hi> for hee lighted the great fire of the Punicke warres againſt the Romanes, whereby in the end the Carthaginians were utterly ruined: All this proceeded but from the Partialitie which was at Carthage: for as ſoone as the Hannonians reaſoned one way, the Barchini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt needs reaſon to the contrarie, and they ſtudied for nothing, but that by the pluralitie of their voices, their opinion might obtaine the upper hand, without any care or conſideration, what opinion was the beſt: And thus ordinarily happeneth it, where there is any Partialitie: For then men give themſelves more to contradiction, than to judge after an wholeſome ſentence, and without paſſion of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and expedient.</p>
                  <p>The Partialities of the houſes of Orleance and Burgoigne (in our grandfathers

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> memorie) were they not cauſe of infinit miſeries and calamities, wherewith France was afflicted by the ſpace of more than threeſcore yeares? and of the entier ruine of the Bourgonianne houſe? <hi>Lewis</hi> duke of Orleance, the alone brother of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, tooke for his deviſe <hi>(Mitto.)</hi> Duke <hi>Iohn de</hi> Bourgoigne tooke for his <hi>(Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio)</hi> challenging as it were thereby an egalitie with the only brother of the king, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour, that he was richer than hee: This commencement of contrarie devices, which they cauſed to paint in their banners of their launces, and on their ſervants li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie coats, erected a great Partialitie; inſomuch, as the duke of Bourgoigne enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to cauſe the duke of Orleance to bee ſlaine (as hee did.) The children of the duke of Orleance (becauſe juſtice was not executed on their fathers maſſacre) levied

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> armes: Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo by armes reſiſted them, inſomuch, as all the realme was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized about the quarrell of theſe two great houſes: After, duke <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſlaine at Monterean-fante-Yonne, in a ſtrange manner: whereupon his ſonne <hi>Philip,</hi> willing to revenge himſelfe, ſent for the Engliſhmen, which he cauſed to paſſe through Fraunce, and occupied at leaſt the third part of the kingdome of France. This duke <hi>Philip</hi> made peace with the king, but he had a ſon <hi>(Charles</hi> his ſucceſſour) who would never put truſt in the king of Fraunce, fearing himſelfe, becauſe of the warres which his father and grandfather had raiſed in the kingdome, but would needs graple with king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh. This king (who was too good for him) raiſed him up ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies on all ſides, that the houſe of that duke came to ruine. Behold the fruits

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of partialities, which <hi>Machiavell</hi> recommendeth ſo much to a prince! And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould well be noted, the ſaying of maſter <hi>Philip de Comines:</hi> That Diviſions and partialities are very eaſie to ſowe, and are a ſure token of ruine and deſtruction in a countrey, when they take root therein, as hath happened to many monarchies and commonweales.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>De Comines</hi> to prove his alledged ſaying, ſetteth down other examples, The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie of the houſes of Lancaſter and Yorke in England, whereby the houſe of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter was altogether ruined and brought downe, and the one houſe delivered to the other, ſeven or eight battailes betwixt three and fourſcore princes of the royall blood of England, and an infinit number of people. This here is no ſmall thing, but it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> an example, which ſhould make us abhorre all Partialities. Hee further ſaith, That by the meanes of the ſaid Partialitie betwixt theſe two houſes, many great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and lords were baniſhed and chaſed from England, and amongſt others, that he ſaw a duke of the houſe of Lancaſter, the cheefe of the league of that houſe, and brother in law of king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, who ſaved himſelfe in Bourgoigne, yet in

ſo poore eſtate, that hee went bare foot and without hoſe after the traine of duke

                  <p>In the time that <hi>Anniball</hi> made warre upon the Romanes, there were created <note place="margin">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fiftie thouſand men, which loſſe happened by the diſcord &amp; Partialitie of two cheefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <hi>Paulus Aemylius,</hi> and <hi>Terentius Varro.</hi> Theſe examples mooved the Senate to exhort theſe two Conſuls, <hi>Livius</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> to a reconciliation, not beleeving that their Partialitie could ſerve them for any thing, but evill to conduct the affaires of the commonweale; inſomuch, as being conſtrained by the Senates authoritie, they accorded and reconciled themſelves together, and very well acquited themſelves in their charge, and overthrew together a ſuccour of fiftie thouſand men, which <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball</hi> conducted and brought over into Italie, to <hi>Anniball</hi> his brother: In this defeat alſo, <hi>Aſdruball</hi> himſelfe was ſlaine, and his head ſecretly carried and caſt into <hi>Annibals</hi> campe, who yet knew no newes of that journey: When <hi>Anniball</hi> ſaw

                  <p>The reconciliation then and concord of <hi>Marcus Livius</hi> and <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> were the cauſe of a great good and utilitie to the commonwealth, and remounted the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires <note place="margin">Concord very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> thereof into a great hope, and abated the pride that <hi>Anniball</hi> had taken of the battaile at Cannes; as alſo by the contrarie, the Partialitie of <hi>Paulus Aemylius</hi> (who was a wiſe captaine) and of <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> (who was very raſh and headie) was the cauſe that the Romane Commonwealth was almoſt utterly overthrowne, and that <hi>Anniball</hi> was mounted into ſo great pride and hope, to bee maſter thereof.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> horſemen, ſhould aſſemble their regiments, and by orations give them great thanks, in the name of the Senate, and of the commonwealth, for this their good will, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerve the commonweale: which commiſſion they all executed, highly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the generoſitie of the Romane ſouldiors: Hereby all the world was taken with ſo great joy for this great concord and unanimitie of great and ſmall, to conſerve the commonweale, that every one wept for joy, and cryed on high: <q>That aſſuredly the citie of Rome was moſt happie, invincible and eternall, by this concord: That the knights were moſt brave men, worthy of praiſes: That the people were good and lowable, and that the debonaritie and kindneſſe of the Senate had beene vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the prompt and voluntarie obedience of the people.</q> Here you may ſee what

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> opinion the Romane people had of concord, ſo farre were they off to thinke that Partialities were good.</p>
                  <p>But when wee ſay, That concord is good, neceſſarie and profitable for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the publike good; I ſay not, that heerein is meant, that all perſons which deale in the commonwealth, ought of neceſſitie, to bee of one humour, of one vice and complection; For rather contrary, they muſt needes bee gentle and ſharp, affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fierce, ſevere and pittifull, ſuch as <hi>Appius,</hi> and <hi>Publicola, Catoes</hi> and <hi>Caeſars:</hi> For as in the Lute, if the ſtrings were all of one ſound, the harmonie were worth nothing, but being of divers ſounds, tending to one melodie, it prooves a pleaſant and agreeable harmonie; ſo in a commonweale, or in a princes Counſell, if all were

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of one humour and inclination, their advices and government could not be good, but beeing of divers natures (yet tending to one end, which is the common good) their opinions ſhall alwaies bee better debated, by divers and contrary reaſons, and by concluſions, better taken and better digeſted. This it is which <hi>Tullius Hoſtilius</hi> king of the Romans, ſaid to <hi>Suffetius</hi> dictator of the Albanois; The Partialities (ſaith <note place="margin">

as thou ſaiſt: For wee contend together, who ſhall moſt profit it, great,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or young, ould, or new citizens: And becauſe to maintaine a publike eſtate, two things are neceſſarie, Force in warre, and Prudence in counſell, wee will contend and debate upon them both, who ſhall doe beſt, and who ſhall ſhew himſelfe moſt vertuous in warre, and moſt prudent in counſell: This Partialitie then, which is in counſell, when all men tend to the publike good, are well according diſcordances, which in the end make a very ſweet harmonie.</p>
                  <p>I conclude then this matter, with the ſaying of <hi>Comines,</hi> That if a prince which is in peace, maintaine Partialities amongſt his ſubjects, they will bring him into warr, and if hee bee once in warre, they will bring him unto ruine and confuſion: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, That a prince above all things, ought to take heede, that hee nouriſh no

                  <p>Moreover, the reaſon which <hi>Machiavell</hi> alledgeth, whereby hee would proove Seditions to bee good, is very groſſe and fooliſh: for follow with this, Becauſe Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſometime not the cauſe but the occaſion, that there are made ſome good

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> lawes and rules, That they are therefore good: This reaſon is like the argument of a certaine philoſopher, whom <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> mocketh, who would maintaine, that the fever quartaine is a good thing, becauſe it makes men ſober and temperate, and to guard themſelves from eating and drinking too much. Such philoſophers as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to broach ſuch abſurd opinions, deſerve to bee left without anſwere, with their Seditions and fever quartaines, to draw out ſuch profit from them, as they ſay doe proceede out of them: Doth not the common proverbe ſay, That from evill manners, doe proceede good lawes? and doth it therefore follow, that evill manners are goods? that is, doth it follow, that white is blacke, or blacke white?

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vices, and abuſes, which are in a people: ſo that indeede, no lawes would have beene made, if the people walked uprightly, and committed no abuſes, nor had any vices: For lawes are not ſet downe, but for tranſgreſſors, and to hould intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons within limits, and bounds: Heereof followeth it, that abuſes, vices, ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and luſts, are occaſions of good lawes, and prudent princes and law makers are the efficient cauſes of them; but it doth not therefore follow, that vices, abuſes, and ſtraying luſts, are good things.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is not alwaies true, that which <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith, That Seditions are cauſes, or occaſions of having good lawes and rules: The Seditions which were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up at Rome, by <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> and <hi>Caius</hi> his brother, Tribunes of the people,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which were ſo great and ſanguinary, were not cauſe of any good lawes: They were the cauſe, that they both were maſſacred, as they merited, but they were neither cauſe nor occaſion of any good law or rule: and how ſhould they bee cauſe thereof, ſeeing they tended to authoriſe and make paſſe wicked lawes, and to deſpoile true maſters and proprietors of their goods? For <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> purſued by his Seditious faction that a law (called Agraria) might bee received and authoriſed, whereby it was not lawfull for a Romane citizen, to poſſeſſe above ten acres land, which was as much to ſay, as to take away the more from them, which had more: And becauſe <hi>Marcus Octavius</hi> his companion, in the Tribunate, oppoſed himſelfe to hinder the paſſage of this law, as both wicked and unjuſt; <hi>Gracchus</hi> would needes have had him

would needs deviſe one out of his owne braine; whereby it was ordained, that in all

But this was a wicked law, tending to overthrow and weake the authoritie of Senators, and therefore they hindered it: For <hi>Lucius O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimius</hi> Conſull (by the decree of the Senate) cauſed the people to arme themſelves, and to goe aſſaile <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> with the ſeditious of his troupe: and in the conflict <hi>Gracchus</hi> was ſlaine, with <hi>Flacchus</hi> his fellow in the Triumvirate. Finally, the ſeditions of theſe two bretheren <hi>Gracchi,</hi> tended but to bring forward wicked lawes,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and heereof came no good, but they were cauſe of infinit murders, and of great effuſion of bloud.</p>
                  <p>The ſeditions alſo, which were raiſed up at Rome, by the Triumvirate of <hi>Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> what good brought they to the commonwealth?

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> him: He alſo parted a gold ring in two, and gave one moietie to the king, ſaying: Sir when I ſend you this other halfe, which I keepe, it ſhall be unto you a certain token, that you may boldly come againe, and without feare. <hi>Chilperick</hi> then retired towards the king of Thuringe, and in his abſence the French elected for their cheefetaine, the ſaid <hi>Giles,</hi> governour of a great part of Gaule, which the Romane emperor then held: This <hi>Giles</hi> called <hi>Guiemand</hi> to be about him, as one of his Counſell, becauſe he was reputed a wiſe man: <hi>Guiemand</hi> diſſembled the beſt he could by the ſpace of nine yeares, all which time he was about this <hi>Giles,</hi> yet never forgetting the amitie and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie which hee bore to his king: But amongſt other things which hee counſelled this governour, this was one, that hee gave him to underſtand, that the Frenchmens

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> natures is, to be rudely handled in great ſubjection, and to take great heed they doe not enrich themſelves; for they are farre better poore than rich, and when they are rich, and at their eaſe, then doe they incontinent rebell againſt their prince. Breefely, by this goodly counſell (whereof he deſired ſuch iſſue as after happened) hee put in that Romane governours head, to lay great impoſts and exactions upon the French people, and withall to practiſe cruelties. This was the cauſe that the Frenchmen (by the advice and ſecret handling of <hi>Guiemand</hi> himſelfe) called againe their king <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perick,</hi> unto whom <hi>Guiemand</hi> ſent the halfering which he had. The king returning, the French gentlemen met him even at Bar, where they dealt with him moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably: The king alſo forgave them all new tributes and impoſts, and from thence

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> forward governed himſelfe wiſely, and of a <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> which he had been before his flight, he became after his returne a noble and valiant prince, and chaſed the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes from a good part of Gaule which they held, and greatly enlarged the limits of the realme of Fraunce. Therefore is it evidently ſeene, that the Maxime of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavell,</hi> or the counſell which <hi>Guiemand</hi> gave to <hi>Giles</hi> (which is one ſame doctrine) is not very good, and that the iſſue thereof cannot be but evill.</p>

                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:21818:171"/>
And to argue this point by reaſon, I thinke every man will confeſſe unto me, that <note place="margin">The force of a prince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the riches of his countrey.</note>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it is more expedient for a prince to bee king and lord of a rich and plentifull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, than of a barren and poore countrey: for a withered and poore country cannot nouriſh any great people: Moreover, a poore and barren countrey cannot produce and bring forth things neceſſarie to the tuition thereof, as abundance of corn, wine, fodder, money, and other things. Finally, to make a kingdome ſtrong and puiſſant, (as well to maintaine it, as to augment it) there is a neceſſitie, that it bee copious and rich of all things. And although <hi>Machiavell</hi> in a certaine place where he ſpeaketh of warre, maintaineth, that the common ſaying is falſe, <hi>That money are the ſinewes of warre,</hi> this hindereth not, but that which we ſay may be true: For ſuppoſe it bee true (as <hi>Machiavell</hi> by his fooliſh ſubtiltie maintaines, that it is the good ſoldiors which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are the ſinewes of the warre and not money; yet theſe ſinewes cannot ſtirre, nor bee brought to any great actions, without clapping upon the cataplaſme of money: So that if money be not the ſinewes of warre (after the fooliſh ſubtiltie of <hi>Machiavell)</hi> becauſe they have not of themſelves either motion or operation: yet at the leaſt are they the meanes which cauſeth the ſinewes to moove, and without which ſouldiors can doe nothing, or at leaſt, without paiment, in equipolent kinds to mony, as victu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>als, apparrell, and armour. And if it be objected unto me, that there are ſome poore nations, which notwithſtanding are puiſſant and warlicke, as were the Macedonians in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and theſe were poore in regard of the Greeks, Perſians, and Medes; and as at this day are the Tartarians and Scythians; and as the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Suiſſes were within this hundred yeares: Hereunto I doe many wayes anſwer: That firſt I will not denie, that the nations or poore countries cannot bee but naturally good warriors (as commonly all Northernly nations are, of which number, are the Macedonians, Scythians, and Tartarians; yea, the Suiſſes alſo &amp; the Almaignes hold now of the North) But this their martiall vertue proceeds not from their povertie: For in Affricke, America, and in many other places of Aſia, and in many Iſlands there are many poore nations, yet nothing warlicke: But if poore nations, which are naturally warlicke, become rich in their countrey, they will not therefore leeſe their warlicke vertue: As the Suiſſes at this day are very opulent and rich, yet are they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe valiant in warre, than they were in the time of the battaile of Morat (about

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a hundred yeares ſince) which they got againſt the duke of Bourgoigne: in which time they were ſo poore, that many of them could not diſcerne veſſels of ſilver from peuter, as <hi>M. de Comines</hi> ſaith. The Macedonians alſo, became very rich, after that under the conduct of <hi>Alexander,</hi> they had conquered Aſia, yet remained they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes generous and valiant. The Romanes alſo in time of the foundation of Rome, were very poore, but within a ſmall time they became very rich, yet therefore loſt not their valour and generoſitie. It is not then the povertie of the country which makes a warlicke people, but rather the nature and inclination of the heaven, which likewiſe is much aided, when the countrey may become rich.</p>
                  <p>If there be oppoſed unto me alſo, That we ſee many princes and private perſons, <note place="margin">Riches is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit for a generall, than parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</note>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which doe evill abuſe their riches, as <hi>Caligula</hi> did 67 millions of gold, which <hi>Tiberius</hi> left him; and as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did the great treaſures which hee heaped up in Gaule, and as many others did. Hereunto I doe two wayes anſwere: Firſt, I ſay, it followeth not, that r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ches and treaſures are evill, becauſe ſome abuſe them, no more than wine is to be condemned, becauſe many are drunke therewith. And although there bee ſome princes and other perſons which have abuſed their riches, there are alſo many which
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:21818:172"/>
uſe them well. I moreover ſay, that the conſequence is not good in this caſe, from

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the particular to the generall: For I confeſſe well, that it ſhould be better and more profitable for the commonwealth, that in a countrey there were many houſes mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich, than ſome little number exceſſively rich, becauſe ofteneſt that exceſſe proves very pernitious to him that enjoyeth it, who is thereby ſometimes incited to ſtray out of the limits of lawes and temperance. But ſuppoſe it true, that great riches is moſt commonly domageable to particulars; it therefore followeth not that they are not, nor may bee in a countrey in generall: but the more rich a countrey is, ſo much more is it ſtrong and puiſſant, if ſo be that it be ſo well governed, as the particulars abuſe not their richeſſe: which they will not doe (eſpecially being under the yoke of good laws and good magiſtrates) if every man have not too great abundance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but in a mediocritie according to their qualities and degrees: for ſuch a meane

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſeemes very requiſit and profitable, becauſe they are meanes and aids to come unto vertue, and to bee exerciſed therein: but the exceſſe is often pernitious, as it was in many particular Romanes in <hi>Caeſars</hi> time, which were ſo exceeding opulent &amp; rich, that their exceſſive riches drew them out of the limits of vertue, to give themſelves unto all luxurie, and to enterpriſe novelties and changes.</p>
                  <p>But when I ſay, that unmeaſurable riches are pernitious moſt often to particular <note place="margin">A prince ought not to the ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize.</note> perſons, I meane alſo of the perſon of a ſoveraigne prince: For it is neither good nor profitable, that a prince doe treaſure up nor make heapes of riches: for it ſerves but for a bait, to draw unto him enemies, or to engender quarrels and diviſions after him: &amp; we often ſee, that princes great treaſures are cauſes of more evill than good.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> That infinit treaſure of threeſcore and ſeven millions of gold, which <hi>Tiberius</hi> left af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, for what good purpoſe ſerved it? It ſerved to commit a thouſand villanies and unprofitable expences, full of corruptions, which <hi>Caligula</hi> would never have made, if he had not found that treaſure? And the treaſure which <hi>Charles le Sage,</hi> king of Fraunce, left behind him, wherefore ſerved it, but to ſowe enmitie and diviſion amongſt brethren: for <hi>Lewis</hi> duke of Anjou got it, for which the dukes of Berry and Bourgoigne bore him evill will, and on their ſides alſo (to get treaſures) they cauſed great exactions to be laid upon the people. And what good did this treaſure to the duke of Anjou? but tended to the deſtruction of him and his treaſure, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the realmes of Naples and Sicilie. The great treaſures of king <hi>Croeſus</hi> of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> incited him to warre againſt king <hi>Sirus</hi> of Perſia and Media, to his owne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The treaſures of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> king of Macedonie, made him put ſo great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his forces, that hee would needs have warre with the Romanes, and ſo loſt all, together with himſelfe. Breefely, it is neither good nor profitable for a prince to heape up, nor to have great treaſures and riches encloſed in one place. And what then? muſt a ſoveraigne prince be poore? No: But contrarie, he had need bee rich and very opulent: for otherwiſe he ſhall be feeble and weake, and cannot make head againſt his enemies: but his riches and treaſures muſt be in the purſes and houſes of his ſubjects, that is to ſay, a prince muſt ſo deale, that his ſubjects by good handling

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
                     <note place="margin">The ſureſt treaſure of a prince, is in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects purſes.</note> and maintenance of good peace, may abound and be rich, that their townes may be maintained in their liberties and franchiſes, and in free commerce, and that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer and all others may be comforted and preſerved from extraordinarie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive impoſts, and from exactions and pillings of magiſtrates, and of a companie of ruffians and violent perſons, which under colour, that they hold the place of an Archer in the kings militarie ordinances, or ſome horſeman, therefore will they eat
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21818:172"/>
and ruinate the poore labourer and others, under colour of a commiſſion to receive

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> tenthes, and of others under pretext to receive ſome taile or money royall, and of others under diverſe other pretexts: For to ſay true, the pettie and inferiour people is as much or more foiled and ſpoiled by magiſtrates, and ſuch as uſurpe the office of magiſtrates, as by the impoſts of mony which are deſtined for the prince. If a prince then ſhoot at this marke, that through all his countrey and lands of his obedience, his ſubjects be rich and abundant, and that there be the greateſt number that can be of good and rich houſes, then ſhall there be ſo many treaſurers for him, and he ſhall never want in his need: For the nobleman ſhall ſervein good order, yea, at his owne expences if need be in affaires of warre; the merchant and laborer ſhall furniſh him with ſilver and ſouldiors; the Cleargie will willingly contribute their tenthes: breefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the prince ſhall find ordinarily good and aſſured recourſe in his ſubjects purſes, which will be the beſt treaſuries he can have: for in place to give great wages to other treaſurers (which can often ſubtilly ſteale from their prince, without being percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) theſe treaſurers will take no wages of their prince, nor ſteale from him, neither will his treaſure periſh in their hands. And truly, the true and aſſured riches of a prince, which he cannot leſe, and which cannot faile him, is the richeſſe of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: for other of the princes treaſurers may be undone by the povertie of collectors of the princes debts, or by ſome other chance of warre or ſhipwrack; but the treaſure that is in all the peoples hands, is not ſubject to hazards: And therefore the prince cannot better treaſure up wealth and enrich himſelfe, than by growing rich by good

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> dealing with his ſubjects. The Venetians (which are wiſe Politickes) uſe this: For it is a capitall crime in their commonwealth, to ſpeake of gathering money for a publicke treaſure: But their particulars are ſo rich, that the publicke cannot bee poore.</p>
                  <p>By the aboveſaid reaſons it ſeemeth unto me, that the Maxime of <hi>Machiavell</hi> is <note place="margin">Povertie makes men enterpriſe novelties.</note> ſufficiently confuted; and that it is ſeene, that a prince for the good of his eſtate, ought to maintaine his ſubjects rich and not poore: For to ſay that poore ſubjects will be more tractable and obedient, and will more eaſily thruſt their heads under the yoke, and wil better beare burdens when they are laid upon them, it is rather con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie. This was the opinion of the emperour <hi>Galba,</hi> who ſaid (when one told him,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that <hi>Vitellius</hi> enterpriſed upon the empire) that there were no people leſſe to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than ſuch as are every day in thought to live, and therfore he being ſuch an one, was not to be feared. But <hi>Galba</hi> knew well in the end, to the loſſe of his life, that his ſaying was not true, and that a perſon in neceſſitie will ſeeke all meanes, good &amp; bad, right and wrong, to obtaine his purpoſe. The ſame cauſe of povertie made alſo <hi>Otho</hi> to enterpriſe to aſpire to the empire: For he himſelfe ſaid, that he had rather die in warre, in hazarding himſelfe to come to an empire, than to die in priſon for his debts. Therefore ſaid <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> to ſuch as were poore and great ſpenders, or which were loadened with crimes, that they ſtood in need of a civile warre; meaning, that the <note place="margin">

If it were needefull to confirme this by examples, to ſhew, That poverty hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> times been cauſe of great inſurrections and civile warres: We reade that at Rome <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dion Halic. lib.</hi> 5. 6. 7.</note> there were many ſtirrs and ſeditions againſt uſurers, which eate up, and impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people, and cauſed great faintneſſe. The like often happened in France: for in the time of king <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> the conquerour; in the time of S. <hi>Lewis;</hi> in the time of king <hi>Iohn;</hi> and many other times, the Iewes and Italians, which held bankes, <note place="margin">Annal. 3.</note> and practiſed uſuries in France, whereby they ruinated the people, were chaſed and banniſhed out of the kingdome. The factions of Mailotins, and of ſuch as carried coules, and hoods of divers coulours, and other like popular inventions, tending to ſeditions and civile warres, were not founded upon any other foundation than that, For poore people of baſe eſtate, are alwaies the authors &amp; executioners of ſuch fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſeditions. In the time alſo that France was under the obedience of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> empire, we reade that the Gaulois roſe up often, when they ſought to impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh <note place="margin">Dion in Aug.</note> them by undue exactions: As in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> there was in Gaul one <hi>Licinius,</hi> a receiver of impoſts, who practiſed great and undue exactions upon the people, unknowne to <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and becauſe at that time, part of Gaulois pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tributes, each chiefe of every houſe a certaine ſumme by moneth; this maſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver made a weeke but ſixe daies, and a moneth, but of twentie foure daies; ſo that in the yeere, were foureteene moneths, and ſo two fell to his profit: <hi>Auguſtus</hi> being advertiſed heereof, was much grieved, yet did no juſtice thereon. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſent for governour into Gaul, <hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi> who was a great lord, and before had had the government of Siria, where he had filled his hands: Ariving

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in Gaul, hee ſought to doe there, as hee had done in Siria, and began to commit great exactions upon the people, and to deale with them, after the Sirian manner, (that is) like ſlaves: The Gaulois ſeeing this, made a countenance, voluntarily to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie <hi>Varus</hi> and his army, againſt the high Almaines, upon which hee made warre; but after they had conducted him and his army into a ſtraight, whence hee could not ſave himſelfe, they ſet upon him, &amp; defeated &amp; cut his army in pieces. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> &amp; the other great lords of his company, ſlew themſelves in diſpaire: And heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Gaulois rebelled againſt the Romane emperours many times; as under <hi>Nero,</hi> under <hi>Galien,</hi> &amp; under many others, and at the laſt freed and cut off themſelves altogether from the obedience of the empire: Whereupon I conclude, That to

But to many it may ſeeme, that that we have aboveſaid, tendeth too much unto

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the diſpraiſe of Povertie, which notwithſtanding ſeemes to bee praiſed and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by our Chriſtian religion: But hereunto I anſwer, That Povertie of it ſelfe, is neither praiſeable nor vituperable, but men muſt judge of them according to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. For if it bee ſuffered with an holy patience, by a Chriſtian man, who takes in good part, and contenteth himſelfe with the vocation, whereunto God hath called him, and with the meanes which he hath given him: and if it bee accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a ſimple and gentle ſpirit; aſſuredly ſuch a Povertie may bee placed in the ranke of the greateſt vertues: For it is no ſmall vertue to bee able well and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beare Povertie, without ſtraying out of the path, but rather a very difficill and rare thing: Therefore the Panims themſelves, praiſed and admired <hi>Ariſtides, Phoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

Yet ſo much there wanteth, that Chriſtian doctrine approveth this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie of begging; that contrary it forbiddeth plainely, that none bee ſuffered to beg: And likewiſe the word of God witneſſeth unto us, That good men will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie ſuffer their children to beg their bread, for alwaies God aſſiſteth, and giveth them meanes: Therefore Monkes called Mendicants, have gone too far, in praiſing, extolling, and exalting Povertie, not taking it as it muſt be underſtoode by the word

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of God: And ſo it is like they will ſoone repent, that from the beginning they have made ſo deepe a profeſſion of Povertie, againſt which they have many times ſince pleaded, kicked, and ſpurned, yet could never bee rid, nor diſpatched of it, but alwaies have beene compelled by Popes and Parliaments, alwaies to hould and obſerve it as a thing wherein lay and lyeth all the perfection of the orders: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this account and narration is pleaſant to tyred and wearied readers, I will a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſcourſe upon the warres of theſe Mendicant friers.</p>
                  <p>You muſt then know, that theſe Mendicants, at their firſt entrie into the world (to renowne their names) propoſed to themſelves, ſtraightly to follow the eſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <note place="margin">How the Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt Povertie &amp; loſt the cauſe.</note> that by their owne merits they might enter into Paradize, and cauſe others

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to enter into favour of them, and with their authoritie: This eſtate of perfection, they conſtituted in three points, Chaſtitie, Obedience, and Povertie: Of the two firſt points, wee will not ſpeake heere, but onely of the laſt point, which is Povertie: Of this Povertie alſo they have made three kinds, High, Meane, and Baſe: High Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie (which the Franciſcan Friers attribute unto themſelves) is that which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this world, neither in proper nor in common any way, that is, neither fields nor houſe, nor poſſeſſion, nor rents, nor penſion, nor beaſts, nor moveables, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, nor bookes, nor rights, nor actions, nor fruits, nor any other thing in the world. Behold here indeede a ſoveraigne, pure, and exceeding neere Povertie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there neither wanteth any thing, neither is there any thing to be reprooved, ſince

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> it hath nothing at all. The ſecond kind (which is for the Dominicans and Iacobins) is a Meane Povertie, which hath nothing particular or proper, but only ſomethings in common, as bookes, apparrell, and daily victuals. The third and laſt kind (which the Carmelites &amp; Auguſtines have retained for themſelves) is Baſe Povertie, which may have proper, common, and in particular, whatſoever is juſtly neceſſarie to life, as apparrell, bookes, certaine penſions, and ſome lands, for helpe of their kitchin, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:21818:174"/>
neceſſitie of their living. And it is good, to note in thoſe good brethren the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and Auguſtines, how humble they ſhew themſelves, to bee contented with ſo baſe a kind of Povertie, without any deſire to mount higher, as acknowledging themſelves, unworthie and incapable, for to aſcend into ſo high and ſuperlative a degree.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Mendicants then (being obliged and reſtrained unto Povertie, by a ſolemn vow which they make at their profeſſion, in their orders) they are ſo annexed, united, and incorporated in it, and with it, that never after they could be never ſo little ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſmembred, what diligence or labour ſoever they uſed to do it; hereof they have found themſelves much troubled and ſorrowfull: For howſoever gallant and goodly the Theorique of Povertie is: yet in practiſe they have found it a little too

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> difficile and hard. And indeede, if you conſider more nigh, the Theorique thereof (eſpecially of that high and ſoveraigne Povertie) I know not whether you can finde any thing in the world more excellent or more admirable: For they which make profeſſion thereof (in my opinion) come ſomething nigh an Angell like nature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Angels have no need of the uſe of the earthly &amp; corruptible goods of this miſerable world, but onely take care of divine and ſpirituall things. More alſo, they which make profeſſion of this high Povertie, have this advauntage over the rich men, which poſſeſſe the goods of this vale of miſerie, that they are not wrapped in ſo many miſcheefes and travailes, which accompanie thoſe goods; but are franke and free, taking no care nor thought for ploughing, manuring, ſowing, reaping, grape-gathering,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> lopping of trees, grafting, eradicating, cutting, planting, building, ſelling, buying, or doing any other like things, which concerne the affaires of the world: From all theſe things they are free and exempted, having nothing which hindereth them to be in a continuall contemplation and meditation of divine things, to come in time unto a great and deepe wiſedome, yea, to approch to the Angelicall nature of the Cherubins and Seraphins, which have no other occupation, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and exalt the Divinitie. But alſo if on the other ſide you conſider the great difficulties in this ſo ſtrict and ſtraight uſe of Povertie, you ſhall find it verily a ſad and unpleaſant thing: For it is an approoved Maxime, as well of the Mendicants, as of all other monkes, yea, of all men in generall, <hi>That every man must live:</hi> But a man

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cannot well live, with contemplations and mediations; for the bellie is not ſatisfied with ſuch viands, but it muſt needs have bread and victuals, which grow and proceed from the earth and poſſeſſions of this world: Whereof it followeth, That they muſt needs have poſſeſſions to obtaine victuals, or at leaſt, they muſt buy and obtaine of them, unto whom poſſeſſions doe belong.</p>
                  <p>But the profeſſion of Povertie (eſpecially of that high one) repugneth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieth all this: For thereby it is not lawfull to have any poſſeſſions, nor to acquire corne, wine, or other victuals, for as much as by the acquiſition thereof (whether it be by ſale, donation, exchange, or other like) the acquirer and obtainer thereof makes himſelfe a proprietor and maſter of the thing which hee obtaineth; which is not

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> lawfull to doe for ſuch as make profeſſion of high Povertie, which can no way bee propriators of any thing, be it moovable or unmoovable, victuals, apparrell, or any other thing whatſoever, as is ſaid. Therefore you ſee, that the practiſe of Povertie is ſomething greevous and troubleſome, and not ſo pleaſant as the Theorique: For as for Theorique, you cannot find a thing more pleaſant nor facile, nor which leſſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth a man in worldly affairs, nor which meriteth more to be praiſed and eſteemed
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:21818:175"/>
in all good companies, and eſpecially in great feaſts and bankets, after the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which ſaith:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Hee that implete is of viands,</l>
                     <l>Fasting, to others recommands.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But upon theſe difficulties touching the practiſe of Povertie, the Mendicants have made many great queſtions and ſcruples of conſcience, which many Popes have ſought to reſolve, yet could never ſatisfie nor content thoſe brethren. Amongſt others, the Friers Minors were greatly troubled in their ſpirits upon this; that by their rule (which the bleſſed S. <hi>Francis</hi> left them) it is ſaid by an expreſſe article, That the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> brethren of that order can have nothing proper in any manner, neither may they have any meanes to live, but to beg hard and without ſhame: For there are amongſt them which thinke, that this may be underſtood of ſimple proprietie, and not of uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructe or uſe thereof: So that retaining the uſurpation only of poſſeſſions and other things graunted unto them, rejecting the proprietie of them, they thinke not to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate any part of their rule. But they that give this interpretation of the rule, dare not juſtifie their interpretation thereof, leaſt they contradict the teſtament and laſt will of bleſſed S. <hi>Francis,</hi> their founder; whereby hee had ordained and expreſſely forbidden, That none ſhould gloſe upon his rule; and that none ſhould ſay, that it ought to be underſtood thus or thus; and that none ſhould obtaine Apoſtolicall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> from the Pope, either to adde thereunto or declare: inſomuch, as on the one ſide, not daring to adventure to give declarations and new ſence to the rule, &amp; on the other ſide, beeing held ſo ſhort thereby, that they dare, neither have nor acquire any thing, their conſciences are mervellouſly troubled and tormented; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſince ſome of their adverſaries call them theeves, and prooving it by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whoſoever poſſeſſeth or eateth another mans goods, whereas hee hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor can have any thing of his owne, hee is a theefe: But the Mendicants, and eſpecially the Friers Minors doe poſſeſſe habites, bookes, moovables, chambers, bribes, aſſes, and other moovable goods, and do eat bread and pittance, in all which goods they can have no right of proprietie, nor other: <hi>Ergo</hi> then, &amp;c. Vnto which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> argument aſſuredly they cannot anſwere: For if they replie, that in theſe goods by them poſſeſſed, they have the uſe ſimply without any proprietie; beſides, that they have given an interpretation to the ſaid rule, againſt the teſtamentarie prohibition of their glorious founder; a man may replie upon them, that if they will ſay they have a right of uſe in the ſaid goods, it will then follow, that that right ſhould be to them in proprietie, and that therefore having the proprietie of that right, they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes find themſelves breakers and gainſayers of their rule, which prohibiteth, to have any thing proper, whether poſſeſſions, rights, or other goods. Hereat let every man thinke, if it muſt not needs be very greevous to thoſe good Friers Minors, that men ſhould thus argue againſt them by ſubtile arguments, to proove them theeves,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> as living on other mens goods, and of that which was not theirs, like birds of prey: And ſo much the more this pincheth them, becauſe they ſee, that high Povertie (whereby they pretend to mount to the degree of perfection) is the cauſe whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this blame and diffame commeth. But they dare not well complaine nor ſpeake a word, but onely tollerate all things in all patience and humilitie, not without great ſcruple of conſcience, which many amongſt them make, whenſoever they thinke in
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:21818:175"/>
their ſpirits, that that which they eat, is not their owne, neither the apparrell that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they weare; and that they have not nor can have in them any propertie, any right, any uſufructe, nor any ſimple uſage: yet could they not ſo repreſſe this their greefe of mind, but it would by many tokens breake out; yea, and that meat, which with ſad minds and ſtriving conſciences they had crammed their bellies withall, was againe diſgorged and vomited. Finally, after they had remained a long time in that anguiſh and perplexitie of ſpirit and of conſcience, it happened that they created a Pope at Rome, who in his youth had been a Frier Minor, who was called Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>C. Exiſt. de verb. ſig.</hi> 6. <hi>Platina in Nicol.</hi> 3.</note> third. The Friers ſeeing, that ſuch a Pope (who once was one of theirs, and who knew the difficulties which were in the practiſe of this High Povertie) could not bee but favourable unto them, held a Chapiter generall, where they reſolved to ſend cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> delegates and embaſſadours to this Pope, humbly to beſeech him to do them this favour and grace, as to take away and cut off all the ſaid difficulties. Theſe dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates then in the yeare 1280 haſted towards the S. Paternitie of this Pope, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from the Chapiter generall of their order, the great and indiſſoluble difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein they were, for the intelligence of the rule of bleſſed S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and for the obſervation of the prohibitions contained in his Teſtament, and generally for the whole practiſe of that High Povertie; humbly beſeeching his ſaid Paternitie to provide therefore, as he knew to bee requiſit: yet they moſt humbly ſhewed unto him, by forme of advice (without any mind of preſumption, to give any interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſaid rule) that it ſeemed unto them, that the glorious S. <hi>Francis</hi> neither

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> underſtood nor would, that they ſhould be left naked of all goods: For by the ſame rule, he had commanded them to obſerve the Goſpell, and to follow the traces of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: But Ieſus Chriſt (ſaid they) had a purſe and ſilver in it, as wee reade in the Goſpell, and that therefore they thought it ſhould bee permitted unto them ſo to have alſo. Moreover, they ſaid, by rejecting the goods and teſtimentarie legacies, that good Chriſtians would give them, that they ſo ſhould bee homicides of them ſelves, and tempters of God, becauſe they deprived themſelves of things neceſſarie for the conſervation of their lives: Alſo, that this great and High Povertie leadeth to the eſtate of beſtialitie: becauſe wee can obtaine no knowledge, without having bookes either in proprietie, or in uſe. Alſo, ſuppoſe they ought to have nothing at all

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> proper in particular, it therefore followeth not, that they ought to have nothing in common: and therefore that his Holineſſe might well permit them to have goods under the common name of the Covent. And that the bleſſed S. <hi>Francis</hi> having commanded them by his rule to beg hardly, &amp; without ſhame, by conſequent hath permitted them to take whatſoever any man giveth them in almes, be it moovable or unmoovable, ſilver or cloth, to enjoy or uſe as their owne. Moreover, they humbly remonſtrated unto him, That often in caſes of maladies, and other neceſſities, they were forced to borrow, which they could not repay, unleſſe they had whereof to doe it: and that therefore it was neceſſarie unto them to be permitted to acquire &amp; heape up, to ſatisfie ſuch as had lent them in their neceſſitie for their credit ſake. Vpon this

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſupplication and remonſtrance, Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> cauſed to aſſemble the colledge of Cardinals, which in their Conclave examined well this great cauſe; and by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice hee ordained and declared, That the Friers Minors could have nothing in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie, neither in particular, nor in common, becauſe the true perfection of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſiſteth in this point, to be diſpropriated every way of all goods, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or retaining in them any right: But he reſerved unto them the fact (and not the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:21818:176"/>
right) of the uſage of goods, which by legacies, or otherwiſe, might fall and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> unto them, retaining to himſelfe and to the Romane Church the proprietie of thoſe goods: Conditionally alſo, that this fact and deed of uſage bee not exceſſive, and that in the ſaid Friers, there alwayes ſhine a notable and apparent Povertie: And anſwering to their reaſons, hee ſaid, That our Lord Ieſus Chriſt deſiring to yeeld to our infirmities, and to condiſcend to our imperfections, thought it good to have a purſe and ſilver in it, but yet that notwithſtanding to have a purſe and ſilver, is of it ſelfe an action of humane infirmitie and of imperfection. And as for that they ſay, that the abdication and rejection of all proprietie of goods, may proove an homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide of himſelfe and a temptation of God: he anſwereth no: but that the true way to perfection, is altogether to commit himſelfe to the providence of God, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> any care to provide for living; and that the meanes of begging (which by their rule was permitted unto them) could never faile them: and that alſo neither was it needfull to have ſtore of victuals, that they might the better obſerve their ſaid rule: but eſpecially in that article, whereby they are enjoyned to faſt every Friday, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giles, Advent, and Quadrageſima, which commeth to halfe the yeare or therabouts: And that as their Povertie ought to be ſtraight, ſo their victuals alſo ought to bee ſtraight and ſober, and that they ought to eat little: for it agreeth beſt with that ſo high Povertie. And as for that they ſay, that it may be lawfull for them to have goods in common: hee anſwereth, that is very evident, no, becauſe the rule reſtraineth them to a rejection and abdication of all proprietie: and that which is common to many,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> may well be ſaid by right to be proper to all in <hi>Genere,</hi> or generall, and to every one in <hi>Specie</hi> or particular. And finally, upon that laſt point wherein the Friers doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that in caſes of neceſſitie they are forced to borrow, and that therefore they deſire permiſſion to acquire, to repay; Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> anſwereth them, That they have not well proceeded therein, to contract either borrowing or lending, becauſe in that kind of contract there is a tranſlation of proprietie from him that lendeth, in him which receiveth: And as the Legiſts ſay: <hi>Mutuum est cum fit de meo tuum,</hi> that is, A thing is lent, when that which is mine, is made thine. To ſhun therefore this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, hee gave them an acute and an ingenious counſell; which was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and find meanes, that they which had devotion to give to their Covent, ſhould

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> appoint for them principall payers in their place, of things which were neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in their maladies, or otherwiſe, towards them, which would furniſh them thereof; or that they ſhould name ſome one (of whom they might be aſſured, to him that would give them any legacie) to be executor of his will, by employing the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to ſatisfie the furnitures made, or to make, for the Friers: Vpon condition notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that the proprietie and poſſeſſion of the ſilver or other thing bequeathed, bee in no ſort transferred unto the ſaid Friers, but alwayes to remaine with him that bequeathed it. Behold in ſumme, how Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> reſolved the difficulties of the Mendicants, touching the practiſe of their povertie: For he permitted unto them the uſe of goods which fell unto them, and reſerved the proprietie of them to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Church: and beſides permitted them to accept Teſtamentarie legacies, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons interpoſed. Wherein hee well ſhewed what a good friend he was of that order, and that he forgot not the place wherein he was nouriſhed in his youth, yet left he a ſcruple in his bull: wherupon there fell out no leſſe contentions than before, becauſe he circumſcribed his permiſſion or indulgence, with this condition: <hi>That alwayes there ſhould ſhine in theſe Friers, an holy and manifest Povertie.</hi> This was a condition
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:21818:176"/>
which touched them very nigh, as ſhall bee ſaid hereafter.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the Mendicants ſeeing themſelves to have a permiſſion by his Apoſtolicall bull of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to cauſe legacies and foundations to be given unto them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent they begun to practiſe themſelves diligently to have them. And becauſe they conſidered, that by ſermons they might eaſily draw the devotion of the people towards them, they ruſhed upon that practiſe with all their might: which ſo well ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded unto them, becauſe the biſhops and curates of that time (as for the moſt part they were at that day) were but beaſts, and could not preach at all, neither well nor ill, but the moſt ſufficient onely knew their maſſe at the moſt. The Sermons then of theſe Mendicants, being of great eſtimate and credit with the people, they ſtraight drew unto them ſtore of legacies, penſions, and foundations, they never forgetting,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> (either at the beginning or end of their Sermons) to recommend the works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie towards their covents, deciphering their neceſſities at large, and very eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, aſſuring the good people, that they might thereby gaine Paradice for them and theirs, by doing good to their ſaid Covents. By this meanes alſo they drew to them the practiſe of burials and confeſsions, inſomuch, as every man and woman went to the Mendicants to be ſhriven; which failed not, but alwayes enjoyned them for pennance, to give ſomething to their Covents, and to cauſe Maſſes to be ſaid for them. And whenſoever it came to the extreame confeſsion in the article of death, they exhorted the diſeaſed to elect their ſepulture in their Covents, and ſo to give them good legacies and benefites. Breefely, they wrought ſo well and diligently by

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> practiſe upon practiſe, that legacies and benefits even rained on all ſides upon them, to the great prejudice of Curates, which loſt almoſt all their auncient and accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med oblations, and which ſaw their offertories and ſuffrages to goe to nothing in their open ſights, to their great greefe.</p>
                  <p>This was the cauſe that about the yeare 1311, the Curates (being countenanced <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>De Sepult. in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travag.</hi>
                     </note> by biſhops) complained much to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight<hi>:</hi> ſaying, that the Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants troubled them in their auncient poſſeſſorie of Sermons, Confeſſions, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultures, and that they thought it was moſt reaſonable, that they to whome apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the charge of ſoules, ſhould alſo have the bodies of the dead to burie, and that they ſhould heare them in confeſſion, unto whom they adminiſtred the ſacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Moreover, they ſhewed, that the Mendicants invented many novelties, as to preach within their Covents, at the ſame houre that the Curates ſaid their parochiall maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that they alſo preached withour their Covents, without either the Biſhops licenſe, or the Curate of the place: And by ſuch practiſes and novelties, the ſaid Mendicants had taken away from the ſaid Curates the moſt part of their obventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and revenues, and ſo brought their eſtates almoſt to nothing: therefore moſt humbly they beſought his Paternitie to remedie thoſe abuſes, and to maintain them in their auncient poſſeſſions. Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> upon this complaint of the Curates (for which all Biſhops and Prelates entreated) would give proviſion, and by his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which he made, with the advice of his brothers Cardinals, he exhorted much the Curates to take patiently, that the Mendicants have right &amp; authority to preach,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> confeſſe, and burie, ſhewing them, that it was free to the people, to goe heare a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to confeſſe themſelves, and to chuſe their ſcpulture where they thought good.

                  <p>The Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> having made this ordinance and rule betwixt the Curates and Mendicants, ſoone after they entred further than ever, into contentions and debates: For when Curates went into the Mendicants Covents to aske their fourth part of the practickes and obventions of the ſaid Mendicants, they would ſtraight joine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and make ſuch a ſhouting, braying, and hiſſing at the poore Curat, calling him beaſt, ideot, aſſe, and ſaying he could not well reade his Maſſe, nor decline their name: And further, would aske them certaine pettie queſtions out of Grammer, and bid them turne ſomething into Latine, to ſhame them. And thinkeſt thou beaſt (ſaid they) that we have taken paines to prepare meat to put in thy mouth? Belongeth it unto the Aſſe, to reape that which wee ſowe: Goe, goe beaſt to thy Breviarie, if thou

Theſe poore Curates then (ſeeing the ſaid Mendicants approch them, beating one hand againſt another, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe their coules, and lifting up their fiſts) in a great feare retired out of their Covents. And knowing no way poſſibly to obtaine their due, which had been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> they offered their greefes and ſorrowfull complaints to Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the eleventh, in the yeare 1304, or thereabouts. But the Mendicants

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> were not cowards, to remonſtrate alſo their good right on their ſide, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons eſpecially ſhewed, that as by good right none wil withdraw a Falcidie or fourth part from devout &amp; godly legates; ſo none ought to take a fourth Trebelliane from their practickes and obventions, ſeeing they were beſtowed on them for godly cauſes alſo. Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> after good deliberation upon this waightie matter, with the advice of his Cardinals, and of certaine other good old doctors of Law, found, that the Mendicants their reaſons were well founded in right, and that there was no apparent reaſon, wherefore they ſhould pay to the ſaid Curates the fourth part of their practickes and obventions: For although there was ſome colour in that, that the Curates ſaid, That they ought to have the fourth part of obventions and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of Mendicants, becauſe they had the name and title of Curates, even as an heire ought to have the fourth Trebelliane free, becauſe he hath the name and title of heire: yet in this rule there is a fallacie (ſaid theſe old doctors) in regard of Legates for godly and devout cauſes: For Legates are exempt from delivering of fourth parts: ſuch like as thoſe which Mendicants take of godly Chriſtians. And for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their opinion, they alledged <hi>Godfredus in Summa, Azo, Hugolinus de</hi>

                  <p>Yet hereof engendred a greater quarrell than ever, betwixt the Curates and Mendicants: For the Curates ſaid high and cleare, That Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> had done them wrong, to take from them the ſaid Trebelliane upon practickes and obventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mendicants, and that thoſe new come beaſts would have all, and would ſpoile all Curates of their goods and revenewes: And that under the title and name of Mendicants and contemners of the goods of this world, they manifeſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to bee rapinous hypocrites, which will needes have all, by right or wrong.

                  <p>But Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentie of that name, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1324, tooke yet from

them the ſaid uſage of Fact, and ſent them purely and ſimply to their clap-diſh, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> begging for their living, ſaying, That the ſaid uſage of fact, reſerved to Mendicants, imported and attributed unto them a propertie; becauſe the act of uſe is proper to them which exerciſe it; and therefore whoſoever hath that act of uſe, hee by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent hath ſomething proper, which after hee concludes by his bull, that all that goodlie ſubtiltie and invention of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to leave the uſe of goods to Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants, and to reſerve the propertie of theſe goods to the Romane church, was but a ſimulation and hipocriſie, wherewith the Mendicants ſeeke to cover themſelves, and abandon fairely that holy Povertie, wherein they have conſtituted the eſtate of perfection, and whereunto hee ſent them.</p>
                  <p>When the Mendicants ſaw themſelves thus diſgraded and remitted, as deepe as ever into their Povertie, they were much offended, but then there was no order nor

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſaid, that they had priveleges to preach to the people, &amp; to ſay Maſſes, as good and vailable (at the leaſt) as them of Curates, yea the people liked them better, &amp; ſaid they were devout, and more frequented them, than ſuch as Curates ſaid: And withall they ſaid, that in their covents, there was great ſtore of Maſſes, and at all times, to the great profit and commoditie of every man: For they, which for their breakefaſt in the morning, or when they were to ride forth, had neede of a morning Maſſe, they ſhould finde there ſome readie ſaid, at three or foure a clocke: They likewiſe which riſe late, as good old and devout women, found Maſſes at nine, ten, and eleaven a clocke, yea as many as they would, betwixt five a clocke in the morning, untill dinner time: They further remonſtrated, to the paternitie of this holy Father, that the ſaid

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Curates were aſſes, and ſhod beaſts, which could not acquite the due of the leaſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was made in all the yeere, and which lived not upon their cures and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, but ſuffered them to bee ſerved, by as ignorant Vicars as themſelves, which cared not for any thing, but to make profit, by farming their ſaid cures, whereby they committed infinit abuſes, ſeeking onely to clip their ſheepe, without giving them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpirituall foode: But as for us (ſaid they) wee diſtribute unto them ſpirituall meat, in all larges and abundance, as well by celebration of Maſſes, and other divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, as by multiplication of ſermons, within and without our covents: Wherefore it evidently followeth (ſaid they) that we are the true and actuall Curates of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, performing and executing all the acts of legitimate Curates, &amp; that they which ſay they are Curates, are ſo but in a ſhaddow and fantaſie onely, and that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie

with inhibitions to ſuch as called themſelves Curates, and to all others, not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

Vpon this goodlie remonſtrance, containing ſo ponderous and conſiderable reaſons, Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> referred the matter to counſell, and by the advice of his Cardinals, granted to Mendicant Friers, all that they demanded, and cauſed with great expedition to goe out faire and ample bulls, &amp; well leaded: Theſe good Mendicants friers, as ſoone as they had got out their bulls, came ſtraigbt from Rome to Paris, to cauſe them to bee received &amp; regiſtred in the court of Parliament: But before they preſented them to the ſaid court, they adviſed and concluded, that it was moſt expedient to have the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> people favourable, and on their ſides: Therefore through all a whole lent, they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at Paris in all their covents, the contents of their bulls, ſaying, That they onely were the true Curates, &amp; paſtors of ſoules, by the ordinance &amp; creation of the Pope, Gods lieutenant on earth, of whoſe power none ought to doubt; and exhorted the people ſo from henceforth to acknowledge them, to the end to ſhunne the paines ſet downe in our holy Fathers bulls, againſt all contradictions thereof: And in their ſermons they forgot not to make invectives againſt a companie of Curates, which knew nothing, but to take the revenewes of their cures, without any deſerving them, neither ſpared they alſo, to taxe &amp; deteſt their beaſtlie and too notorious ignorance: But yet were they ſomething deceived in their opinion, for at Paris many cures were held, and poſſeſſed by doctors, Theologians of Sorbonne: Theſe doctors, then fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the conſequent of theſe bulls of the Mendicants, and that thereby they might be diſpoſſeſſed of their cures, incontinent mounted alſo into pulpits, to counterpreach and blazon the ſaid bulls, and them which had obtained them: Therefore they ſhewed to the people, That from all times, exceeding all memory of any man living, Curats were in actuall and legimate poſſeſſion, to take and receive tenths, oblations, obven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other fruits, and revenewes, affected and dependants to cures: And the Mendicants, contrary to ther proper profeſſion of mendicitie, were in poſſeſſion, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and injoyance of Povertie, meane, and baſe, reſpectively without any trouble, hinderance, or contradiction, in the knowledge and view of all the world: And that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> therefore every one ought to be maintained &amp; guarded in his poſſeſſion, without any innovation, that is, all Curates of the goods and revenewes of their cures, and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants of their Povertie and begging: and for proofe thereof, they alledged many good places, ſaying it was written; That man muſt give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and to God, that which is Gods, which is to ſay, that wee muſt needes yeeld to every man, that which belongeth unto him, to Curates tenths, &amp; oblations, and to Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, their begging and almes: They further ſaid That it was reaſonable, that the name ſhould anſwere to the thing, and that ſince that Friers, Iacobines, Carmelites, &amp; Auguſtines, have choſen that name of Mendicants, that really and in effect, they ought to be beggers, and not Curates; A ſhort time would not ſerve, to ſet downe &amp;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> diſcover all the reaſons and alligations, which the Curates preached and blazed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, againſt the Mendicants, and the Mendicants againſt Curates: For neither the one nor the other, ever ſtudied better ſermons, than they did in this conteſtation &amp; contention: The Curates defended themſelves, by their long poſſeſſion, and by the ancient and moderne cannons, which aſſigned them their charge of ſoules, &amp; which compare them to Levites; yea even in taking their tithes: They alledged alſo, <hi>Non al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligabis</hi>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:21818:179"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, Thou ſhalt not binde the throate of the Oxe which treadeth out

They moreover ſaid, that it was a mortall ſinne, to give any thing to theſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Mendicants (unles ſome few bribes and almeſſes) becauſe that they which gave them either ſilver or poſſeſſions, or rents, or revenues, made them to be condemned in hell, by cauſing them to breake their vow of Povertie, and by making them breake their rules, which they had ſworne to obſerve. And that they which are the cauſe, that any other doth any evill and ſinne, are as culpable, as hee that doth it. The Mendicants to the contrary, alledged their Apoſtolicall bulls, and the Popes power, and ſaid, It was an hereſie hereſie one of the greateſt, and moſt inſupportable that could be in the world, to ſay, That the ſaid bulls ought to have no place; becauſe that was as much, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke into doubt the high &amp; unmeaſurable power of the great vicar of God: and that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> they which preach againſt the ſaid Apoſtolicall bulls, ſhould feele the ſmart of it. They alſo tooke the places of ſcripture before alledged, <hi>Non alligabis, Et dignus eſt mercenarius &amp;c.</hi> ſaying, that they formally made for them; for they were the true ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en which treade out the graine, &amp; the true workemen which travaile in divine ſervice: and that they ſay more Maſſes in a moneth in one of their covents, than there is ſaid in all the cures of Paris in a yeere: and that for one man and one woman, which thoſe Curates confeſſe, they confeſſe an hundreth, and for one body, which the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates burie, they burie an hundred, and therefore, for Curates to alledge theſe places, they cut but themſelves, with their owne knives: And as for their ſermons (ſaid they) theſe maſters Curates will bee ſo proud, to compare them with ours. Doe not all

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> men ſee, that commonly they can doe nothing, but at the Offertorie, ſpeake a few words, which they have learned by heart from their maſter, to get their offrings in? Doe they not likewiſe ſee, that every one mocks them, becauſe of their ignorance &amp; evill life, and that commonly there is no good play, that hath not a Curate in it? But as for us, you ſee how wee preach (ſaid they) in pulpits, our ſermons are other manner of things, than their proemes, and there is no more compariſon to be made betwixt their ſpeeehes and our ſermons, than to compare a calfe to an aſſe: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if wee ſhould come to a diſputation, to ſpeake Latin, were theſe Curates to be compared unto us? the leaſt novices in our covents, ſhall alwaies ſay a leſſon, more ſufficiently than theſe Curates, if they will but learne it: Finally, all this lent paſſed

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> in ſermons, and conterſermons of the ſaid Mendicants, and Curats, all which of the one part and the other, ſought to winne the peoples favour and devotion, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the fruits &amp; revenewes of Cures<hi>:</hi> After the Lent was paſſed, they came to juſtice, for the Mendicants purſued the reception and enrowling of their bulls, entreating the court of Paris, to admit and allow them, whereupon the ſaid Curates of Paris, formed an oppoſition: As the parties proceeded in their cauſes, they reſpectively
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21818:179"/>
alledged, by intendits, replies, duplications, triplications, the reaſons and meanes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> touched before, and farre more reaſons, which touched the quicke: But the evill luck was for the Mendicants, for upon the point of their good hope, to obtaine the cauſe on their ſide, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> died: Then the Curates beganne to oppoſe againſt them, that the ſaid bulls, had no force nor vigour in them, unleſſe they were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the foure and twentie of that name, ſucceſſor of the ſaid <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi> The Mendicants (much grieved heereat) ſought to obtaine a confirmation, but could not: For the Curates got before them, inſomuch as the poore Mendicants ſeeing themſelves out of hope, to obtaine the reception and enrowling of their ſaid bulls, reſolved to leave the purſute thereof, and the Iacobines firſt left the cauſe, and the others conſequently: So that the Curates were maintained diffinitively, in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> poſſeſſion and enjoyance of their cures, and of the revenewes depending thereunto: and the Mendicants were maintained in their poſſeſſion and ſeaſon of their beggery, with expreſſe inhibitions (accorded by the conſent of the ſaid Curates) not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor moleſt them in any ſort, and each to beare his part of the law charges.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Mendicants ſeeing themſelves fixed &amp; faſtened to their Povertie, more than ever, tooke it with the beſt patience they could poſſibly, for ſo were they forced to do: Yet notwithſtanding, ſome particulars amongſt them, which were the moſt angry &amp; had moſt credit, did ſo much, as they obtained for them, proviſions and reſervations, from the Pope, of certaine cures and other benefices, with diſpenſation to hould and poſſeſſe them, notwithſtanding their vow of Povertie: The aboveſaid Curates of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> France, fearing the conſequence, made their complaints to king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, then raigning: The king by the advice of his Counſell, made an ordinance, in the yeere 1413, wherein hee much praiſeth the rules of the Mendicants founders, in that by them it is ordained, that they ought to live in Povertie and Mendicitie, without having any thing in common or in particular, ſaying that ſuch an ordinance is both ſalutarie and good: And that Povertie is ſo annexed to the Monachall profeſſion of Mendicants, that the Pope himſelfe cannot ſeparate them: which conſidered, hee forbiddeth expreſlie, that none ſhall have regard to the ſaid proviſions, obtained by any Mendicants upon cures or other benefices, and if any bee in poſſeſſion, that hee bee taken out, and they which are not yet received, that none ſhould receive them in:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And commanded all baylifes, ſtewards, and other officers of the realme, not to ſuffer ſo pernitious, yea ſo ſuperſtitious a thing to have place, but rigorouſly to puniſh ſuch as ſtand againſt this ordinance, notwithſtanding all bulls, proviſions, and diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people, to the contrarie: So that by this, the kings ordinance, the Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants were more ſtrongly tyed to the poſſeſſion and enjoyance of their Povertie and beggerie, as well in generall as particular, this happened at the purſute of the ſaid Curates, their adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>But yet a ſtrange caſe it is, that the paſſions and hatred of men, ſhould bee ſuch, as they have no end: The ſaid Mendicants were ſo farre from contentment at this ordinance, that they bare great mallice to all Curates, yea the one beheld the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

Item, that the Mendicants ſhall no more turne away perſons and pariſhioners from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Maſſes, neither ſhall Curates take away the devotion of pariſhioners, from the Mendicants, but rather aide and ſuccour them. Behold in ſumme the articles of this peace, and arbitrarie ſentence betwixt the Mendicants and Curates, which the Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> greatly approved, and generallie exhorred them all to concord and union, in the name and as Vicker of him, who ſaid <hi>Pacem meam do vobis, Pacem meam relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo vobis,</hi> I give you my peace, I leave you my peace: By which articles of the ſaid

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> arbitriall ſentence is ſeene, how theſe Curates and Mendicants publikelie blamed one another: And all this proceeded not but from the ardent zeale they all had, not to the edification of the people, but to have their offrings and oblations: for ſince that time, they could ſo well manage and deale, with the poore ignorant world, that they made them give them whatſoever they would, eſpecially ſuch as were ſick, when they were at confeſſion, and demanded abſolution from purgatorie and hell, they would never abſolve them, unleſſe they gave to their Covents and churches, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they deſired.</p>
                  <p>This concluſion heere is alſo cleane contrarie to the Maxime of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> That Povertie cannot be a cauſe to hould a people in peace and obedience, ſeeing it

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of flatterers, tromperie, the hatred of vertue, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, inconſtancie, and other like vices, whereby hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that men muſt aſcend as by degrees to come unto a ſoveraigne wickedneſſe. Secondly, hee hath ſhewed how one ought to bee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and conſerved in that high degree of wickedneſſe and tyrannie, namely, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining amongſt ſubjects partialitie and ſeditions, and in holding them in povertie and neceſſitie. Now he yet addeth another mean, namely, to build Fortreſſes againſt his ſubjects, as by making in good townes, citadels, and by building forts upon brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and common paſſages, and other like caſtles and fortreſſes: and <hi>Machiavell</hi> thinkes this meane ought to be practiſed, and that other aforeſaid meanes are not ſo

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſufficient, well to eſtabliſh a tyrannie: For Povertie (ſaith he) is no ſufficient meane to containe a people in obedience, for they are never unfurniſhed of armes: And though they ſhould take them from them, and ſhould ſley their cheefetaines, yet that would not ſuffice, becauſe the anger and furie of the people would furniſh them with ſufficient armes, and that cheefetaines would ariſe unto them, like <hi>Hydra</hi> her heads.</p>
                  <p>But I will not ſtay long in the confutation of this Maxime, but onely I will ſay this, That experience makes us wiſe, and that the invention of Citadels (which in our time princes have builded againſt their ſubjects) hath been cauſe of infinit evils: For all commerce and traffique hath been and is greatly diminiſhed in townes, where

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> they have been builded, and there have beene and are committed infinit inſolencies by ſouldiors againſt citizens; and there neither hath come nor will come to princes which have builded them, other good than great expences and evill will of their ſubjects: For this conſtruction of Citadels, is an apparent ſhew, that the prince tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not his ſubjects, but eſpecially, when they are builded any other where, than in the limits and borders of kingdomes and countries againſt ſtrangers. When the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects know that their prince diſtruſteth them, they alſo eſteeme, that hee loveth them not. And when the ſubject is not beloved of his prince, he cannot alſo love him, and not loving him, hee obeyes him not, but as conſtrained, and in the end will get his head out of the yoke, as ſoone as there will fall out a fit occaſion. Here is the profite

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of Citadels.</p>
                  <p>Yet I will ſay this by the way, That our Machiaveliſts of Fraunce, which were authors and enterpriſers of the maſſacres of S. <hi>Bartholmew,</hi> read not well this place <note place="margin">The Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aveliſts of France, doe not alwayes follow their maſter.</note> of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> which wee come to alledge: For they ſaid, That men muſt not ſtay upon fiſhing for froggs, but men muſt catch in their nets the great Salmons, &amp; that one Salmons head was more worth than tenne thouſand froggs; and that when they
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21818:181"/>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the rude and raſcally multitude, which without heads could enterpriſe nothing. Theſe venerable enterpriſers ſhould have conſidered that which here their Doctor <hi>Machiavell</hi> ſaith (which alſo ſince they have ſeen by experience) That a people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want heads, which will alwayes riſe up, yea, even thoſe heads which bee ſlaine.

Therefore to ſhun that blame and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, it is good that the prince delegate and ſet over ſuch matters to Iudges, which are good men, not ſuſpected nor paſſionate, not doing as the emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> did, who would never heare nor receive accuſations againſt Iudges and Magiſtrates, which hee had eſtabliſhed, but conſtrained the recuſators or refuſers, to end their

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> twelve, fourteene, yea, twentie thouſand franks, according as they are, and according to the greatneſſe of the parliaments: For they are not all at one price. But I pray you upon whom do our Machiaveliſts of France beſtow theſe Offices; upon beaſts or ambitious men? For learned men will not buy them, if they be not drawne on by ambition; but they had rather be reputed (as <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid, being put by the Praetorſhip, which he demanded) worthie to be Preſidents or Counſellors, than to be ſo in effect, by the price of ſilver. As for them which are beaſts and ignorant, they have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make proviſion for that marchandize, to get whereof to live, and pay their debts: otherwiſe ſhould they die for hunger, or els bee deſpiſed and pointed at with the finger, for that by reaſon of their ignorance they ſhall be employed in no affairs

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of Iuſtice, and ſhall have no practiſe. And truly, theſe be they, which within this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time have made this kind of marchandize ſo deare: For becauſe they are in great number, thy run thither faſt, with great deſire to have: Which is the cauſe, that the Machiavelliſts ſeeing ſo many marchants to arrive, ſo exceeding eager to buy, doe hold up without all reaſon the price of their marchandize, and will by no meanes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with it, but to him that offereth moſt. But I will not here ſtay to diſpute againſt theſe buyers and ſellers: For I am of opinion, that all their proceſſes ſhall bee made at the firſt Eſtates that are holden.</p>
                  <p>By the reſolution then of the Eſtates of Orleance, it is ſeene, That this Maxime of <hi>Machiavell</hi> was reprooved and condemned, and that it is neither good nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for the commonwealth, that there ſhould bee a great number of Officers of luſtice, but that it were better there were a meane number of them: And this might eaſily be judged and knowne by naturall reaſon. For the prince which ſhall eſtabliſh a great number of Officers to adminiſter Iuſtice, either he muſt make a multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of degrees of Officers, or he muſt eſtabliſh many in one ſame degree. If he make many degrees of Officers, then Iuſtice ſhall be longer, and more prolonged and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious: becauſe they which plead, muſt paſſe through the hands of many Officers, by many inſtances from one degree to another. And therefore it is evident, that the multiplicitie of Officers in degree, cannot bee but domageable and pernitious. If the prince make a multitude of Officers in one ſame degree (as was done in Fraunce

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> when Preſidiall ſeats were inſtituted, when new Counſellors of parliament were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the old, and when many lieutenants and other Officers were new created) the great number will not cauſe Iuſtice to bee better nor more promptly miniſtred: but contrarie, ſhall bee the cauſe of great charge and procraſtination: For much time goes away, whileſt many Iudges are gathered together to one place, to reaſon one after another, and after, as ſaith the Proverbe:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Affaires to many committed,</l>
                     <l>Are alwayes careleſly regarded.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Moreover, ſuters alwayes deſire with their owne mouthes to informe the Iudge of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the principall points of their cauſe, fearing ſomething ſhould bee left out, either by negligence or too much haſt. And withall, which is ſaid in a common proverb, That the lively voice toucheth better than the writing, and better engraveth a thing in the ſpirits of men. This deſire of the parties, to cauſe the Iudge well to underſtand their right, is not reprehenſible, but juſt and reaſonable, and which ought not to be denied
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:21818:183"/>
them: yet in the meane time the multiplicitie and great number of Iudges, maketh

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this point very difficult and uneaſie: For men have not ſo ſoone ſpoken to all, and finding one, he ſtraight finds not another: Moreover, if the matter to judge, be eaſie and without difficultie, wherefore ſerves it to aſſemble a great ſort of Iudges, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the cauſe, ſince one alone can as well diſpatch it, as many? And withall, that one alone can rid more matters in his ſtudie in a day or two, than an aſſembly can doe in a moneth: For a man may labour his cauſe at all houres, in the morning, all the day, at night by candle light, on holy dayes and working dayes, whereas the bodie of an aſſemblie will not travailene ſit but certaine houres, and on certaine daies. If the matter to be judged be difficult &amp; hard, it may ſeeme at the firſt, that many can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judge of it than one alone: becauſe many eyes ſee clearer than one eye alone:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and withall, there is not ſo great appearance of corruption in many, as in one alone: But for theſe difficulties, there are other eaſier proviſions than by multiplication of Officers: For there needs but good conſideration to eſtabliſh in every ſubalterne ſeat, one Officer alone, which were a good man, of good knowledge, and well ſtipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: For being a juſt man, and well ſtipended, he will not be eaſily corrupted, leſſe a great deale (it may bee) than a great number of ſuch as are at this day: and beeing learned, and of good knowledge, hee will eaſily reſolve difficulties: withall alſo in a caſe of difficultie he may take for an aſſeſſor ſome one of the moſt ſufficient Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of his ſeat, &amp; privatly heare in his ſtudie the parties and their Counſell; &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearing, to reſolve of the difficultie in deed and in right, yea, he himſelfe with

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wiſe inſpection into all things with the helpe of his bookes, may diſpatch and rid himſelfe out of all difficulties, being learned and of good judgement, as he had need be. Moreover, inferiour Iudges can hardly judge evill, unleſſe they erre either in Fact or Right: from which they ſhall guard themſelves, if ſupreme Iudges performe well their duties, by not ſparing the perſonall adjornaments againſt ſuch as by groſſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance doe erre in Right, or which by the negligent inſpection into their cauſes, do erre in Fact. And aſſuredly, if ſuch Iudges have good Cenſors, which will marke their faults, and will reproove and correct them, Iuſtice ſhall bee as well adminiſtred by one alone in every inferiour ſeat, as by many. But our ſoveraigne Iudges are glad of the faults of their inferiours: For their evill judgements brings the greater pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> unto them, to fill their purſes, to pay for their Offices, to glut their avarice, and to furniſh the unmeaſurable pompes of themſelves and their wives. So that to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the ſame happeneth which dooth to an humane bodie: For when the head is whole, it will purvey and provide for the neceſſities and maladies of the members, and ſeeke out all things fit for that purpoſe: but when the head is diſeaſed, all the members feele it: So the corruption which is in parliaments, makes, that all Iuſtice in inferiour courts, is depraved and corrupted.</p>
                  <p>I reſolve then againſt the ſaying of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> That it were better, that ther were but one perſon, in every eſtate or degree of inferior juſtice, than a great multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Officers: but my meaning is not, to ſtretch this unto ſoveraigne Iuſtice, but

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> contrarie, I thinke that it is good and neceſſarie, that judgement bee executed by more than one perſon; namely, by a meane number of good, and well choſen men: For a judgement given by a notable companie, hath more waight and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as a ſoveraigne judgement ought to have) than that which comes from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: Alſo becauſe a ſoveraigne judgement, may ſometimes take his foundation upon the pure and ſimple equitie (which ſometimes directly repugneth the locall
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21818:184"/>
cuſtomes, ordinances, and lawes written) it is good and neceſſarie, that equitie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bee juged to bee equitie, by the braine and judgement of many: and it is not meete, that one alone ſhould take upon him, that great licence, to depart from authentike and received lawes, to follow his owne opinion, which hee will call equitie: For that ſhould bee as it were, to give power to every particular Iudge, to judge after his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, againſt received and approoved right, and ſo to ſuffer to paſſe under the name of equitie, huge iniquitie. Since then none may eaſily and without great reaſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from received and approoved lawes, it followeth that none may eaſily alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an equitie, againſt the ſaid lawes, unleſſe to induce it, hee uſe great and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conſideration and examination, and doe well ponder the circumſtances &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, by a good and experimented judgement, which one alone cannot doe, except hee bee of ſome exceeding invention, knowledge, and experience, and of a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> good and ſound judgement, ſuch a one as can hardly bee found: Therefore it is much better, to commit to many (not to every one, but unto ſuch as are well choſen) that power to induce equitie againſt received lawes, than to one alone: Beſides this, it appertaineth unto ſoveraigne judges, to examine the new edicts and lawes of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to marke and note, if there be any thing hard in them, which it were good to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate and lenifie; which they muſt either themſelves doe, before they allow or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge them, or elſe muſt they ſignifie to the prince, a cauſe why they approove them not. This, one alone can never ſo well doe, as many (how great and wiſe ſo ever hee bee) becauſe the ſpirit of one man alone, is not capable, to ſee and comprehend all the particular caſes, which may bee applied to the matter of an edict, neither in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> or cogitation can hee comprehend, whatſoever abſurditie, incommodity, or iniquitie, can bee in a law. But many, caſting and diſcourſing in their mindes every thing, one foreſeeing one thing, and another another, by examining and diſputing upon the matter, may the better perceive and comprehend the law, and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thereof. For it is not to bee doubted, but that by the diſpute of learned and ſufficient men (which doe examine by a good judgement, reaſons contrarie, likely, conjuncts and adjuncts of every thing) may farre better, comprehend the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and in commodities of a edict, than by the reaſoning of one alone. The manner which the Romanes anciently obſerved, in the making of new lawes, ſhewes this, for they which propoſed and preferred them, were commonly men of good ſpirit, great

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> judgement, and experience in the affaires of the common weale; but yet every man (great and ſmall) was heard to contradict that law which was propoſed, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it was found, and often, that a baſe perſon, of ſmall eſtimation, which had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great knowledge nor experience, yet hath noted in that law, abſurdities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, which were cauſes of rejection, or at the leaſt of moderating and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting it. Againe for that ſoveraigne judges, are as it were cenſors and correctors of of inferior judges, it is very requiſit, that they bee many in number: becauſe it will ſeeme hard for a magiſtrate to bee corrected by one alone, unto whom (it may be) hee would not give place in any thing, either in good knowledge or experience: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, becauſe corruption is more to be feared in ſoveraigne judges, which have none

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> above them to correct their faults, than in ſubalterne and inferiors, who themſelves may bee corrected; therefore it is requiſit that ſoveraigne judges bee in number, for many are more uneaſie to bee corrupted, than one alone: I confeſſe then, in the ſoveraigne degree of juſtice of a prince, it is good and expedient, that hee have a ſufficient number of perſons, to exerciſe it, provided alwaies, the number be not too
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:21818:184"/>
great, and unbrideled, for the qualitie is therein more requiſit than the quantitie. The

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> like is, to bee of the kings Counſell, where it is good and requiſit, there bee many heads, as we have ſaid in another place. For confirmation of my ſaying, I will alledge no other thing, than the example of our anceſtors: For in the time, and before king <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, inferior Officers were not many in one ſeate and degree of juſtice, for there was but one in every ſeate thereof, to adminiſter it; namely a Provoſt, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie judge, in the firſt degree; a lieutenant generall, or bayliffe (as they call him) or ſteward in the ſecond degree; but in ſoveraigne courts of Parliaments, and the great Counſell, they were many, yet not in ſo great number, as they bee at this day.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing wee are in hand with meanes to eſtabliſh a good juſtice, I will touch therein ſome ſmall points, which I have marked in hiſtories. Wee muſt then preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <note place="margin">Good Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in good lawes and good Magiſtrates</note> that to cauſe good Iuſtice to bee adminiſtred, a prince muſt needes have good lawes, and create good Magiſtrates and Officers: As for lawes ſome concerne the deciſion of matters, and other the formalitie of proceſſe: Touching ſuch as concerne the deciſion of matters, it ſeemeth well that there hath beene ſufficiently provided, by the locall cuſtome of every countrey, and by the right or law written: Well might it bee deſired, that the doctrines of the docters of the civile, and cannon law, were well choſen, and the good ſet a part and authoriſed: For though in judgements wee can hardlie lacke them, yet are they ſo confuſed, and wrapped with contrarie opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they which hope to finde in the doctors gloſes and commentaries the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome doubtfull queſtion, doe often fall into inexplicable laborinthes, and for

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> treaſure doe finde coales: Which would not come to paſſe, if the good doctrines which often come in uſe, and which are founded upon reaſon and equitie, were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and diſtinguiſhed from the troupe and mixture of thoſe doctors writings. And touching lawes, which concerne the formalitie and conduction of proceſſe and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigations, it ſeemes to mee, there hath beene ſufficient proviſion in France, by Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ordinances: But it ſeemes not to bee ſufficient, that a prince make good lawes, well and rightly to conduct and leade, to the end, the proceſſes and contentions of ſubjects: but it wil bee very requiſit and neceſſarie, that hee make lawes to prohibit and hinder, the birth of theſe proceſſes and contentions; for otherwiſe good Iuſtice and readie expedition of cauſes, ſhall indirectly ſerve for an occaſion to increaſe and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> multiplie, becauſe men will bee made prompt and voluntarie to move actions, when they are aſſured to have ſpeedie and good Iuſtice: So that to ſhunne this, and to make that the thing which of it ſelfe is good and holy, bee neither cauſe nor occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of evill, it ſhall bee (as I have ſaid) very requiſit to have good lawes, to hinder the birth and originall of contentions, wherein it ſeemes to mee, that the ſaid Royall ordinances are defectuous and maimed: So is there great neede of ſome <hi>Licurgus</hi> or <hi>Solon,</hi> to make thoſe ſaid laws, mens wits are ſo wilde, and their ſpirits ſo mervaiſouſly plentifull and fertill, to bring forth contentions and differences, and ſo eaſily to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent one from another: yet notwithſtanding I thinke not that it is impoſſible, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing though not altogether, to repreſſe this ariſing, and ſecunditie of law cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but becauſe it will bee too long now to diſcourſe, wee will reſerve it for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</p>
                  <p>But it is nothing to have good lawes, if there bee not withall good magiſtrates, for their execution: for the magiſtrate, is the ſoule of the law, who gives it force, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, action, and motion, and without whom the law is but a dead, and an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing.

in the world, yea he is a very rare thing, at the leaſt in his time: yet might there

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bee ſufficient in a mediocritie, if they were well choſen and ſought for: But now the firſt that payeth moſt is received, without any care to chuſe the fitteſt: <hi>Dion</hi> writeth, That the emperor <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> had an horſe called <hi>Velociſsimus,</hi> which he ſo much loved, that he made him often to dine and ſup at his table, and cauſed him to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with barley in a great veſſell of gold, and with wine in great caldrons of gold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: Not contented thus, to honour his <hi>Velociſsmus,</hi> hee determined with himſelfe to advance him unto eſtates and offices, and to the goverment of the commonwealth, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Caligula</hi> would make his horſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul of Rome</note> and ſo reſolved to make him Conſull of Rome, and had done it (ſaith <hi>Dion)</hi> if hee had not beene prevented by death. The Machiavelliſtes of this time, which reade this in <hi>Dion,</hi> can well ſay, that this was an act of a ſenceleſſe and mad man, to give ſuch an eſtate to a beaſt: Yet doe they finde it good at this day, to give eſtates to as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſenceleſſe beaſts, &amp; more dangerous than <hi>Velociſsimus</hi> was: for (if the worſt had falne) if <hi>Velociſsimus</hi> had beene created Conſull of Rome, hee could have done no other harme to the commonwealth, nor to particulars, unleſſe it had beene a blow with his foote, to ſuch as had ſaluted him too nigh; but hee would never have made any extortions, pillings, or other abuſes, which the beaſts of our time commit, which are placed in Offices: And this is it which <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith, That wee mocke him which is evill favouredly powled, and him that weareth a rent ſhirt under a ſilke coate, or <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 1</note> that hath his gowne on the one ſide long, and on the other, ſhort: but he is not moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, who waſteth great goods riotouſlie, who overthroweth right, and committeth infinit ſinnes and abuſes in his charge, men will peradventure ſay hee doth evill, but

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> not that hee ought to bee puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>How many Offices bee there in France, more fit for <hi>Velociſsimus,</hi> than for them which hould them: And that which is leaſt perilous, every man doth laughat, but this which is moſt dangerous to a commonweale, no man dare ſo much as ſay, it ought to bee amended, much leſſe corrected: For there is a ſimple beaſtlineſle and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and a malitious beaſtlineſſe and ignorance: The ſimple ignorance is like to that of <hi>Velociſsimus,</hi> which can doe neither good nor evill, but malitious beaſtlineſſe and ignorance, is a beaſtly ignorance of all good and right things, but of a great capacitie to hould all vices and wickedneſſe, ſuch as our Machiavelliſtes: If then a man muſt needes chooſe one of the two; who ſees not that it were more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to chooſe a ſimple beaſtlineſſe? Can any then denie, but it were better to have for a magiſtrate <hi>Velociſsimus,</hi> than ſome of our Machiavelliſts, or our Office-chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which comes by retaile, unto that which they bought in groſſe.</p>
                  <p>But the prince, who reſolves with himſelfe, to eſtabliſh good Magiſtrates (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, hee can have no good juſtice, though his lawes bee the beſt in the world) he muſt conſider and note many things, both in particular perſons, and in bodies in generall: for hee ſhould take notice what an office it is, for which hee ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide an officer, and accordingly ſeeke a perſon whoſe vertue and ſufficiencie may be <note place="margin">Proportion geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to bee obſerved in providing of Officers. <hi>Ariſto. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ethniks.</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> in an inferiour Iudge; and in a Iudge, than in a Chatellaine or caſtle guarder: Heere it is, where ought to bee obſerved the Geometricall proportion whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh, by giving to the moſt fitteſt and ſufficienteſt, the greateſt eſtate, &amp; to them which are meanely fit, meane offices, and eſtates, and the leaſt, to ſuch as are leaſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: This it is, which <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> ſhewed to the Romane people, when they
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:21818:185"/>
would needs create Conſulls, two yong lords, that is, <hi>Titus Octacilius (Fabius</hi> his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nephew) &amp; <hi>Aemilius Regillus,</hi> when <hi>Anniball</hi> made warre in Italie: <q>Maſters (ſaid hee) if wee had peace in Italie, or that wee had warre heere, againſt a leſſer captaine than <hi>Anniball,</hi> ſo that there were place to amend and correct a fault, when it were made, wee would not hould him well adviſed, that would hinder your election, and as it were withſtand your libertie: But in this warre againſt <hi>Anniball,</hi> wee have made no fault, but it hath coſt us a great and perillous loſſe, therefore am I of advice that you doe elect Conſulls, which match <hi>Anniball:</hi> For as wee would, that our people of warre were ſtronger than our enemies; ſo ought wee to wiſh, that our heads and cheefetaines of warre, were equall to them of our enemies: <hi>Octacilius</hi> is my nephew, who eſpouſed my ſiſters daughter, and hath children by her, ſo that I have cauſe to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> deſire his advancement: But the commonwealthes utilitie is more deere unto mee.</q> And withall, that no other hath greater cauſe than my nephew, not to charge himſelfe with a waight, under which hee ſhould fall. The Romane people found his reaſons good, therefore revoked their election, and by a new ſuffrage elected <hi>Fabius</hi> himſelfe, and gave him for a companion, <hi>Marcellus,</hi> which aſſuredly were two great and ſage captaines.</p>
                  <p>This rule to elect magiſtrates equall to every charge, above all ought to bee well practiſed in the election of ſoveraigne judges, for after they have judged, if they have committed a fault, it cannot but very hardly be repaired: ſo that the reaſon which <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> alledged, having place in the election of ſoveraigne judges, the proviſion which

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> followed it, meriteth well to bee drawne into an example and conſequence, for the good and utilitie of the princes ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>The particular qualities, required in a Magiſtrate, cannot better nor more briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Particular qualities required in a Magiſtrate</note> bee deſcribed, than by the counſell, which <hi>Iethro</hi> gave to <hi>Moſes:</hi> For hee adviſed him, to elect people fearing God, true and hating covetouſneſſe: Surely this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell is very briefe for words, but in ſubſtance it comprehendeth much.

                     </gap>uch as do the contrary. If the Magiſtrate feare God, hee will love his neighbour as himſelfe,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> becauſe God ſo willeth, and by conſequent he will guard himſelfe from doing (in the exerciſe of his eſtate) any thing againſt his neighbor, which he would not ſhould be done againſt himſelfe: Briefely hee will in a booke (as it were) write all his actions, to make his account to that great Lord and maſter, whoſe feare hee hath in him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the Magiſtrate bee veritable, and a lover of truth, it will follow that in the exerciſe of his Office, as well in civile, as criminall matters, hee will alwaies ſeeke out the truth, and ſhut his eares to impoſtures and lies of calumniators and ſlanderers, which is no ſmall vertue, wherein Iudges often erre. Alſo, a magiſtrate that loveth truth by conſequent, ſhall bee of ſufficiencie, knowledge, and capacitie, to exerciſe his eſtate: for Ignorance and Truth are no companions, becauſe Truth is no other thing but light, and Ignorance darkeneſſe. And for the laſt point, If the Magiſtrate

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hate covetouſneſſe, hee will not onely guard himſelfe from practiſing it, but alſo he will correct it in others: and by cutting of this deteſtable vice (the root of all evill) he ſhall keepe downe all other vices, which be like rivers proceeding from this curſed and ſtinking ſpring. And as wee ſee, that the covetouſneſſe of wicked magiſtrates is cauſe of the length of law cauſes, becauſe they have a deſire, that the parties which

Hee abode all day in the pallace, to heare and diſpatch cauſes, and hee gave audience to every man very patiently and benignely, and uſed ſpeedie and good Iuſtice, to one and others indifferently, having no regard to perſons, but to the merits and to the Iuſtice of the cauſe then in the queſtion onely: By this meanes

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> 
                     <hi>Quintius</hi> brought to paſſe, that not onely the great men, were no more ſuſpected judges to the meaneſt, but alſo Iuſtice was ſo agreeable and plauſible to the people, that the ſedition ceaſed, and all the people were appeaſed, ſo that none demanded any more to have new lawes, whereby to judge cauſes, but every man greatly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tented himſelfe, to have for a law ſo good and equall a judge, and Magiſtrate. And ſurely there is nothing in the world, which ſooner ceaſeth ſeditions and ſtirres, nor that better maintaineth publike peace and tranquilitie, than a good Iuſtice, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by good and equall Magiſtrates<hi>:</hi> But on the contrary, a wicked Iuſtice is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cauſe of uproares, inſurrections, and civile warres, as poore France can ſay at this day.

But this good Iuſtice endured but a yeere: for the ſecond yeere, the ſaid Potentates being made to continue but for a yeere in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, reſolved altogether ſo to remaine, without ever deſpoiling themſelves of that Office: And to gaine people to their faction, they beganne to doe Iuſtice cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that of the firſt yeere, uſing favour and ſubornation, alwaies giving ſentence

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to the profit of them which were on their ſide, to ſuſtaine their tyrannie: By this meanes they drew many perſons to bee of their factions, and wrought a great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie within the towne of Rome, ſome houlding for the ten Potentates, others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: But in the end their imperious and tyrannicall arrogancie towards one and others, was the cauſe that the partialized people accorded, and great and little ſet themſelves all on one ſide againſt them, wherupon fell their totall ruine: inſomuch
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:21818:187"/>
as the firſt yeare of their eſtate, by their good Iuſtice they brought and maintained a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> good peace in the citie: but in the ſecond yeare, by their evill and wicked juſtice they reduced all into troubles and confuſions within the citie.</p>
                  <p>Vnto this example of the tenne Potentates, might we compare the wicked, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and venale Iuſtice, which hath raigned in France ſince fifteene yeares (which is and hath bene the principall cauſe, and as it were the nurſe of all troubles and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) and that little of good Iuſtice which wee ſee to ſhine (as a lightening, which ſoone paſſeth away) after the firſt troubles in Provence, when the Preſident <hi>de Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> and certain Counſellors were ſent thither: For the little good Iuſtice which they did in that quarter, in ſo little time as they remained there, was the cauſe that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Provence (which naturally are very hot and furious) carried and guided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the other following troubles, more modeſtly than any other of the French nation.</p>
                  <p>We have before ſaid, That <hi>Quintius</hi> patiently heard all them which demaunded juſtice of him: which is a point, that all Iuſtices and Magiſtrates ought well to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: For according to the right of nations and of naturall equitie, none ought to be condemned without being heard. In the time that the <hi>Tarquins</hi> were chaſed from Rome, they underhand practiſed many citizens, by promiſes and otherwiſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a treaſon to the commonwealth, and to eſtabliſh <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Proud in his eſtate. The corrupted citizens procured to them many ſlaves of the beſt ſort of citizens, by promiſes of libertie and other good recompences: inſomuch, as all the hired peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> being in a very great number, concluded upon a ſecret conſpiration, that the ſaid citizens ſhould one night ſeize upon the ſtrongeſt places of the towne; and that the ſaid ſlaves ſhould ſley their maſters in their beds as ſoon as they ſhould hear a noice that ſhould be made through the towne, for a watchword: and this being done, ſome ſhould goe and open the gates to the Tarquins. There were two brethren, <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Publius Laurentius,</hi> which were of this conjuration: theſe many times were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in their beds in ſleepe, by hideous and fearefull dreames, this made them go to their Divines, to know from whence theſe dreames proceeded. The Divines told them they proceeded from ſome wicked enterpriſe which they had in their heads, which they could not well bring about, &amp; it were good they left off, that they might

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be no more tormented with ſuch dreames. This was the cauſe, that the two brethren diſcovered all the conſpiration to <hi>Servius Sulpitius,</hi> one of the Conſuls. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> ſaw an evident and nigh perill to the commonwealth, if ſuddainly it were not provided for: yet did he not thinke it good to deale in the puniſhment of the culpable, before they were well vanquiſhed and plaine matters averred againſt them (as our Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſts of this time doe, which take law againſt men after they have ſlaine them) but ſecretly communicated the fact to the Senat. The Senat referred to him to proceed in that matter as he thought fitteſt for the utilitie and conſervation of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> conſidering then, that amongſt the conſpirators there were many great perſons and well allied, and that he might reape great envie and hatred, if hee

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cauſed any to die without an open conviction of the fact, hee reſolved to bring the cauſe to a cleare and evident proofe. He then tooke ſuch order, as the ſtrong places of the citie were guarded by good men on a certaine night aſſigned, and ſo ſent to <hi>Tullius Longus,</hi> his companion in the Conſulſhip (who then beſieged the towne of Fidenes) that he ſhould come to Rome with a good part of his armie: and he dealt ſo, as he arrived nigh the gates at the houre of midnight, at the night aſſigned, and that
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:21818:188"/>
there he ſhould ſtay, til <hi>Sulpitius</hi> ſent him word. This done, he gave charge to the two

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> brethren <hi>Laurentines</hi> (which had diſcovered the enterpriſe unto him) to advertiſe their complices, as from the ſide of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> to execute their deſſeigne that night, and that they all ſhould meet in the market place, the better to know what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſhould doe. This was ſo done: inſomuch, as the conjurators being altogether aſſembled in the publicke market, the Conſull <hi>Longus</hi> was aſſigned to enter into the towne with all his forces, and ſo in the market place were all the conjurators environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and wrapped in by the good order that <hi>Sulpitius</hi> had taken: ſo that they were all by this meanes convicted of the fact: inſomuch, as none of their parents or allies could denie the crime. This was the cauſe that every man ſaid after (when it came to the puniſhment of the conſpirators) that it were a good deed to puniſh them, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that <hi>Sulpitius</hi> had well performed his dutie. Breefely, by this cleare &amp; evident proofe which <hi>Sulpitius</hi> drew out of this conſpiration, he obtained great honour and praiſe, whereas hee ſhould have heaped upon himſelfe great envie and evill will of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and parents of ſuch as were culpable, if he had cauſed them to be executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great and evident verification of the crime.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as for example: A parliament and judgement ſeat (which ought to bee compoſed of many) ought not to be made of men, all of the Nobilitie or of the Clergie, or of the third eſtate, but ſome of every eſtate: Likewiſe, it ought not to be compoſed of men all of one towne, but they ought to bee taken from divers juriſdictions or dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes: And thoſe two points have aunciently been obſerved in France, according to royall ordinances ſo enjoyning. But in the time wherein we are, wee may adde by the like reaſon, That in a parliament or the like ſeat, they ought not all to be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Romanes, and none of the Reformed Religion: For if the eſtate of the Clergie for the conſervation of her priviledges, hath well obtained, that in all ſuch places there be magiſtrates of the Clergie (although they bee of the ſame religion in all

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> points with the Catholike Lay-men) why ſhould they denie it to men of the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpell? To this purpoſe we reade, That at Rome there was a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was many more knights in the aſſembly of Iudges ſoveraigne of cauſes, than of Senators: inſomuch, as by ſoveraigne judgement, <hi>Publius Rutilius</hi> (who was a good and ſincere man) was condemned to baniſhment (becauſe hee had repreſſed the exceſſive and undue exactions of Publicans in Aſia) being evill beloved of the knights, which were the greater number of the aſſembly. The Senatours diſdaining and grieving at this wicked judgement, ſtirred up <hi>Livius Druſus</hi> Tribune of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: at whoſe purſute there was a law made, That from thence forward the Senatours and knights ſhould be of a like number in the judgements of cauſes: Which law was

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> found good and profitable to the commonweale? as by the contrary they found not good that law which before <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> (who alſo was a Tribune of the people) would have cauſed to paſſe, wherby he ſought to theſe, that in the judgement of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there might be two knights againſt one Senator: For herein there is no equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nor equitie; and therefore by good reaſon that law was rejected, yea, and to the ruine of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> who was ſlaine in the too earneſt purſute of that law.</p>

Finally, ſo much the greater

                  <p>A Prince having by good election well ordained the magiſtrates of his Iuſtice, <note place="margin">A Prince ought to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh evill Iudges, and to reward good men.</note> hee ought after, to conſider how hee may maintaine them in their dutie to walke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and to keepe themſelves from corruption. To doe this, hee muſt obſerve two things: To caſſier them which deale evill in their charge, yea, that hee puniſh them according to the greatnes of their faults, and that he recompence &amp; remunerat them which deale well in their charges. Wee have above ſet downe ſome examples of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> emperours, which chaſtiſed their vicious magiſtrates, which examples doe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit well to be drawne into a conſequence, at the leaſt for great faults of magiſtrats: But above all, a prince ought alwayes to have before his eyes the example of the king S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who of his kingdome ſent often Commiſſaries throgh his provinces to get information of the abuſes of magiſtrates, that he might doe juſtice thereof: For this example meriteth well to be practiſed in the time wherein we are. Moreover, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> practiſed very well theſe two points, wherof now I ſpeake: <note place="margin">Lamprid. in Alex.</note> touching the puniſhing of evill magiſtrates, and remunerating the good. For on the one ſide he ſo hated wicked magiſtrats, which abuſed their Offices, that one day there comming to his Court one <hi>Arabinus,</hi> who was reported to have committed thefts

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> in the adminiſtration of his Office, he begun in a great choller. O gods immortall? <hi>Arabinus</hi> not onely liveth, but dare appeare in the Senate, and before mee. On the other ſide, <hi>Alexander</hi> would remunerate and bountifully reward ſuch magiſtrates as were good, and well acquited themſelves in their charges: For (ſaid hee) good magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates which are good men, muſt be bought and enriched: but wicked men of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue muſt be impoveriſhed and driven away. Wee may alſo alledge the example of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:21818:189"/>
the moſt part of our ancient kings of France, which ſtipended well their Officers of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Iuſtice: For although it ſeeme, that the wages which they take at this preſent is little; yet at the time when their wages were firſt conſtiuted and ſet downe unto them, they were great and ſufficient ynough to maintaine them unto whome they were given. And there is no doubt but a man might as well and honourably maintaine himſelfe ſome 60 years agoe with 300 pound a year, as now for 1000, for truly, ſince that time, all things have proved foure times dearer. Whereupon it followeth, ſince expences are quadruple, and that the wages of magiſtrates are not raiſed, that it were requiſite they were augmented, the rather to encourage them to doe their duties, and to take from them all occaſion and excuſe of abuſes.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon ſome have thought, that to ſhun abuſes &amp; corruptions of magiſtrats,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it were good and expedient to make them temporall, as for two or three yeares, or els <note place="margin">Magiſtrates in Fraunce ought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee temporall nor ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorie.</note> to make them ambulatorie, by remooving of them from time to time from one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to another. This opinion hath been held by a great perſon of our time, which ſeemeth to be founded upon many good reaſons: For if magiſtrates were temporall, by conſequent they ſhould be ſubject to the Syndiks, and to give account of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration: and if they were ambulatorie, they ſhould not know the perſons ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their juriſdictions, neither could they contract with them any inward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie and love, which often doe cauſe Iudges to ſtray out of the right way, &amp; do draw the curtaine from the eies of Iuſtice: And both by the laws of the Romans, and the ordinances of king <hi>Lewis,</hi> and many other kings his ſucceſſors, the magiſtrates of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Provinces could neither be perpetuall, nor might they be magiſtrates in the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they were borne. Yet if we conſider, that France is compoſed of divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which have every one their courſes of law, different, wee ſhall find, that it were impoſſible to find magiſtrates fit to adminiſter juſtice in every ſeverall province for want of knowledge of the different ſtiles, cuſtomes, and manners of every ſeverall countrey, which are not well learned but by uſe and practiſe: And alſo old men and many perſons very capable to exerciſe offices of magiſtracie, neither can nor wil ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to an uncertaine removing from one province to another: for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of their familie could not well beare it, yet every man muſt have care of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. We ſee alſo, that men advanced to Offices, although men learned &amp; capable,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yet at the firſt have not had the dexteritie well to applie their knowledge to uſe, for it is obtained by the handling of matters &amp; experience. Wherupon it followeth, that if magiſtrats were temporall, they ſhould be at the end of their time even then when they begun to underſtand how they ought to handle their Offices, &amp; by appointing deputies in their places, the like would come to them: and ſo would it come to paſſe, that in Offices there would be placed, more often new men than well experienced; a thing neither good nor profitable to the commonweale. And for this cauſe we read, that the emperour <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> continued alwaies in his time his magiſtrats, which <note place="margin">Capit. in Pio.</note> in their Offices acquited themſelves well. And in the time of <hi>Severus,</hi> and other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors after him, it was practiſed, that to the Office of the Praetorian praefecture, they

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhould alwayes provide ſome one of them which before had ſerved as an Aſſeſſor, and knew therefore how he ſhould handle that Office. And certainly, in the Romans time there was this incommoditie in the matter of magiſtrates, that often they were at the end of their time, before they underſtood how they ſhould adminiſter; as a captaine <hi>Niger,</hi> lieutenant of the warre for the emperor <hi>Marcus Antonine,</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him. But that incommoditie was much more ſupportable in that time, than <note place="margin">Spart. in Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro.</note>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:21818:190"/>
at this day it can bee, in Fraunce: for the Romane magiſtrates ſeldome decided pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and particular cauſes: but in Fraunce, magiſtrates muſt deale in all cauſes.</p>
                  <p>After that the prince hath well eſtabliſhed his juſtice as well by publication of <note place="margin">A Prince ought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Iuſtice.</note> good lawes, as by inſtitution of good magiſtrates, yet is he not diſcharged: For he ought himſelfe alſo to deale therin. And this is another point of the Counſell which <hi>Iethro</hi> gave to <hi>Moſes:</hi> For after he had counſelled him, what magiſtrates hee ſhould eſtabliſh under him, he added more, That <hi>Moſes</hi> ought to reſerve unto himſelfe the knowledge and deciſion of great affaires, which are of conſequence. And aſſuredly, this is a point very neceſſarie, and which a prince ought not to leave behind: for hee is debtor of Iuſtice to his ſubjects, and ought to give them audience in things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is to have neceſſarie knowledge: for all things are not proper to bee handled before magiſtrates eſtabliſhed by the prince: but there are many things, wherof the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> knowledge ought to appertaine to the prince alone: as when a meane man wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine againſt ſome great lord or magiſtrat, or againſt Publicans and exactors of the princes money, or when a man labours for a pardon, gift, recompence, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like: The prince then ought himſelfe, either alone, or in his Counſell to give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten audience unto his ſubjects: For we reade, that by the primitive creation of kings <note place="margin">

The ſecond point was, To convocat an aſſembly of a Senat, to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> handle the affaires of the commonwealth. And the third, To be the cheefetaine and ſoveraigne of the warre. And for as much as the firſt dutie of kings conſiſteth, to do good juſtice unto their ſubjects, the auncient Grecians (even <hi>Homer)</hi> calleth them <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is to ſay, Diſtributers of juſtice. This is it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore almoſt all good princes have had their ordinary daies of Audience, wherin they took knowledge of the complaints and grievances of their ſubjects, and adminiſtred right and juſtice unto them. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> tooke great paine and travaile to heare cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to adminiſter juſtice, and to cauſe them to obſerve lawes which concerned <note place="margin">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Audience, which he continued untill night: yea, being evill at eaſe, he in a litter would be carried to the pallace, or hold Audience in his houſe. The emperour <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> alſo (although hee were of an heavie and dull ſpirit) yet held hee his Audience, and adminiſtred right to parties. So did <hi>Domitian,</hi> who (how wicked ſoever he was in other deportments) with great induſtrie and diligence adminiſtred good juſtice unto parties, and often revoked decrees from the Centumvirat ſeat, which for favor were given, and ſpared not to puniſh corrupted Iudges. The emperour <hi>Galba</hi> likewiſe (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was of the age of threeſcore and twelve yeares, when he came to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) yet dealt with audience of parties, and adminiſtred juſtice. So did <hi>Traian, Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the <hi>Antonines, Severus, Alexander,</hi> and many other Romane emperors give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to their ſubjects, and adminiſtred juſtice unto them. And very memorable is that which is written of the emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> namely, That one day as hee went into the fields, he was required by a poore woman (who had watched to ſpeake with him) to doe her juſtice upon a certaine complaint ſhe made unto him: The emperour ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Dion. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian.</note> kindly ſaid unto her, That that was no place where ſhe ſhould require juſtice, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:21818:190"/>
ſent her away till another time: The woman replied upon him: Sir (ſaid ſhe) if you wil

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not doe me juſtice, wherefore deale you to be emperour? <hi>Adrian</hi> was never moved hereat, but ſtaied ſtill, heard her, &amp; did her juſtice. If we read the hyſtories of France, wee ſhall find, that it hath yet beene more ordinarie and common with our auncient kings to hold Audiences (which men called <hi>Lict de Iuſtice,</hi> The Bed of Iuſtice) than with the Romane emperours. <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> king of Fraunce, and emperour, beſides <note place="margin">Annal. upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

King <hi>Lewis</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the firſt of that name (ſurnamed <hi>le Debonaire,</hi> becauſe of his good and holy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) following the traces of <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> his father, held a publicke Audience in his pallace three times in the weeke, and heard the grievances and complaints of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, executing to all quicke and right juſtice. But what good came there here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Even this (ſaith the hyſtorie) that the publicke good in this good kings time, was ſo well governed and adminiſtred, that there was almoſt no man found amongſt his ſubjects, which complained, that any man did him wrong or injurie, but al men lived in great peace and proſperitie, one not daring to offend another, for the feare they had of the kings good juſtice, which he would adminiſter himſelfe, and ſo cauſe his miniſters to doe after his example. So much could that royall vertue of Iuſtice doe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for the maintenance of peace and proſperitie in a kingdome. King <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> (ſurnamed the Conquerour, for his great proweſſes and conqueſts) was alſo a good Iuſticer, and willingly heard the complaints of his ſubjects: inſomuch, as one day underſtanding, that <hi>Guy Counte de Auverne</hi> uſed greatly to pill and violently to ſpoile his ſubjects and neighbours, exacting upon them great ſummes of money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils, and without the kings conſent their ſoveraigne, and having found him culpable hereof, condemned him (by the advice of the barons of the realme) to loſe his land and ſeignorie of Auverne, which from that time was united to the crown. We may alſo place here the good juſtice of the kings, <hi>Charles le Sage, Charles</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, and of many other kings of France, <note place="margin">Annal. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Anno</hi> 1255 <hi>&amp;</hi> 1269 <hi>Gaguin</hi> in the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which gave oedinarie audience to the complaints of their ſubjects, and to doe them juſtice. But it ſhall ſuffice to cloſe up all this matter with the example of that good king S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who amongſt other vertues wherewith he was endowed, he was a very good and upright adminiſter of juſtice. This good king having a great zeale to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a good Iuſtice in his kingdome: firſt hee would and ordained, That the good and auncient lawes and cuſtomes of the kingdome ſhould be well and ſtraitly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, upon the paine he would take of his Bayliffes, Seneſhals, and other magiſtrates, if they cauſed them not to bee well obſerved. And to the end the ſaid magiſtrates might carry themſelves well in their offices, he choſe other officers, the beſt that hee could find, of which he ſecretly enquired of their vertues and vices. And to the end

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they might adminiſter good and breefe juſtice to the poore as to the rich, without exception of perſons, he forbad them to take preſents (unleſſe ſome preſent of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which may not exceed tenne ſhillings by the weeke) nor any other benefites for them or their children, neither of them which were in contention, nor of any other perſon of their bailiwike and territorie, and commaunded they ſhould take nothing within their perfecture or juriſdiction: For this good king conſidered, that preſents,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:21818:191"/>
benefits and deſire to gain, are the means wherby magiſtrates may be corrupted, and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> therfore to ſhun all corruption, he muſt cut off the meanes therunto. Moreover, he very rigorouſly puniſhed ſuch officers of Iuſtice as abuſed their eſtates, &amp; ſpared not even great lords themſelves, but puniſhed them after their merits: as happened to the lord <hi>de Coucy,</hi> who cauſed to ſtrangle two yong Flamins, when he found them hunting in his woods. For the king cauſed to be called before him the ſaid lord, who fearing to be handled as he had delt with the Flamins, wold have taken the hearing of the cauſe from the king, ſaying, he was to be ſent for before the peeres of France. But the king forced him to abide his judgments, &amp; indeed had made him die, if great lords (parents &amp; friends of the ſaid lord <hi>de Coucy)</hi> had not importuned ſo much the king for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: unto which the king accorded, that he ſhold have his life, but yet he condemned him to the warre againſt the Turks and Infidels in the holy land by the ſpace of three

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> yeares (which was a kind of baniſhment) and beſides condemned him in a fine &amp; pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 10000 Paris pounds, which were beſtowed on the building of an Hoſtle Dieu at Ponthoiſe. This king gave not eaſily any pardon, nor without great deliberation: And (for a deviſe) he had often in his mouth that verſe of the Pſalme of <hi>David: Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie are they which doe iudgement and Iuſtice at all times.</hi> He ſaid alſo, That this was no mercie but crueltie, not to puniſh malefactors. Moreover, he was a king full of truth, chaſt, charitable, and fearing God; which are vertues exceeding woorthy for a good prince, and which commonly accompanie good juſtice. But the godly precepts hee <note place="margin">The tenne commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which the king S. <hi>Lewis</hi> at his diſeaſe, gave to his eldeſt ſonne.</note> gave (being in extremitie of his life) to king <hi>Philip</hi> the Hardie, his ſonne and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> doe well merit to be written in letters of gold upon the lintels of doores, and the houſes of all kings and Chriſtian princes, to have them alwaies before their eies. My deare ſonne (ſaith he) ſince it pleaſeth God, our Father and Creator, to withdraw me now from this miſerable world, to carrie mee to a better life than this; <q>I would not depart from thee my ſonne, without giving you for my laſt bleſſing the doctrines and precepts which a good father ought to give to his ſonne, hoping you wil engrave in your heart theſe your fathers laſt words.

But our gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen at this day (at the leaſt many) have letters and ſciences in too great deſpight, and doe thinke it doth derogate from their gentry and nobilitie, if they know any thing, and make a mocke at ſuch as deale with a pen and inckhorne, which is one of the greateſt vices which at this day raigneth amongſt the Nobilitie.

I will alſo note another notable vice, which runnes currant amongſt gentlemen at this day, which is, That they make ſo great accompt of their Nobilitie of blood, that they eſteeme not the Nobilitie of vertue; inſomuch as it ſeemeth to ſome, that no vices can diſhonour or pollute the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Nobilitie and gentry which they bring from their anceſtors. But they ought well to conſider, that to their race there was a beginning of Nobilitie, which was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the firſt that was noble, in conſideration of ſome vertue which was in him. If then the Nobilitie and gentrie of race tooke his originall and ſpring from vertue, it followeth that ſo ſoone as it houldeth no more of the ſaid ſpring, it is no more Nobilitie, nor gentrie, no more nor leſſe than the water which commeth and ſprings from a neate and cleere fountaine, when it polluteth and corrupts it ſelfe in filthie boggs, carres, fennes, and miery ſinkes, ſhall bee called the fountaine water, ſince it hath corrupted it ſelfe in filthie mire and clay, but ſhall bee accounted cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſtinking water, although it runne from a moſt pure and cleare ſpring. We

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> reade that the emperour <hi>Marke Antonine,</hi> made ſo great account of the Nobilitie of vertue (although hee himſelfe was moſt noble, and of an ancient race) that in compariſon of it, hee made no eſtimate of Nobilitie of race, therefore married hee his daughters to perſons which were not of great ancient Nobilitie, but to ſuch as were wiſe and vertuous, ſuch as none were found like amongſt the moſt illuſtrious races of Rome. <hi>Maecenas</hi> alſo was a great lord in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> iſſued of a royall race, yet hee made no account of that Nobilitie of blood, in compariſon of that true Nobilitie which is of vertue: Hee loved, honoured, praiſed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched learned men, yea was very familiar with them, and had them ordinarily at his table, although otherwiſe they were of baſe race: This his love and favour, which he
